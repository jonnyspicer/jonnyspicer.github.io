This is the source code for my personal site, hosted at [jonnyspicer.com](jonnyspicer.com). The site is built using  Github Pages and Jekyll, and is covered by the GPL version 3 license.

As there are now a couple of forks of this site floating around the internet, in the future I plan to make my theme a bona fide Jekyll theme, and also provide more details on how to use
this site as a template for your own blog.
