Yesterday was the first time I'd been to the Vale Earth Fair since I was about 14, and it was a lot of fun. As various acts pointed out, it was probably one of the only summer
music festivals in the world that actually went ahead this year, and everyone seemed to be especially appreciative that we had the opportunity to listen to live music, drink
overpriced beer and queue 20 mins for a disgusting portaloo together. The acts were pretty good, I bumped into everyone I've ever met, and I even managed to get in for free. Maybe
it wasn't the festival that I'd planned on attending in 2020, but I'm grateful I got to go anyway, and who knows, maybe I'll go back again next year.
