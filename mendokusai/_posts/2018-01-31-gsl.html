  One of the main benefits of being back in this timezone is that I can get up early to watch the GSL, and that's exactly what I did today. I got to watch my old hero, Maru, battle it out in his RO32 group. First he lost two macro games vs KeeN and I was pretty surprised/sad, worried he might not make it out of the group. He breezed past Ragnarok to face KeeN again... and proxy two raxed him twice in a row. I remember why I always wanted to be like him now; what a boss.
