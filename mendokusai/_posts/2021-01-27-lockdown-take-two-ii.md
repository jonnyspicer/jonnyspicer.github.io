In the past few days since we've re-entered lockdown, my habit of overthinking things has got really, really bad. Apparently I was doing a pretty good job of distracting myself by
being as possible beforehand, but not there's nothing to drown out my thoughts and I'm stuck with them. It's just so exhausting, I wish I could just turn my brain off, but given that
I've committed to not drinking for the whole month, that's not an option.

Maybe I ought to try meditation again or something, it's too loud inside my head at the moment.
