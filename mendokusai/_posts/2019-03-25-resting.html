  One of the most undervalued components of improving one's mental health, is simply not
  trying to improve one's mental health. It may sound counterintuitive, and
  likely that's why people don't talk about it as much as they perhaps should, but
  I think it is absolutely vital in order to bring about a marked difference to
  your wellbeing over a long period of time.

<p>
  The reason is pretty simple - trying to become a better, healthier person is
  exhausting. By nature, people who struggle with mental health issues tend
  to find themselves fairly tired most of the time anyway, so piling on the
  extra emotions of struggling to change will only make this worse. If you push
  yourself too hard, you'll burn out, just like with anything else.

  Sometimes it's OK to struggle, to procrastinate, to be sad, to do things you
  shouldn't - that's human nature. Not everything has to be about overcoming
  your issues and obtaining enlightenment - on some days, you can say "hey,
  I've made a lot of progress recently. Today I'm just gonna rest, and not do
  anything scary", and I wish more people talked about that.

  Try and become a better person during the week. On the weekend, just enjoy
  being who you are.
