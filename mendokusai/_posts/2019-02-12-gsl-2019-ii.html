  Have I really only written about the GSL twice?!
</p>

  I'm exhausted, today I worked 11 hours and then had a 3 hour chess game afterwards.
  But I refuse to let my fatigue get me down, because it's Scarlett's GSL group
  tomorrow, and I'm significantly more excited about this than I was about
  Christmas.

  Gogo Scarlett fighting!
