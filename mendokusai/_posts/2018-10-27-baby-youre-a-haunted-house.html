  Today Gerard Way released a new song titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaxHIYOzMUQ"
  rel="noreferrer">Baby You're A Haunted House</a>, his first release in two years,
  with pretty much no warning. It's quite Hallo-meme-y, but I like it a lot.

  Like everyone else who experienced teenage angst in the mid to late oughties,
  I love Gerard's music, it got me through some tough times and went on to shape
  my now (hopefully) more refined music tastes. As an artist he has clearly grown a lot,
  from literally screaming out the lyrics, "I'm not OK", to a much more mature sound
  on his later solo work, and generally seeming at peace, something I think a lot
  of his fanbase, drawn to his music because he sang about struggles they identified with,
  should try to emulate. Cheers, Gerard.
