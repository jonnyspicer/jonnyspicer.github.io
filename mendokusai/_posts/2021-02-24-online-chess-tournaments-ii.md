In lockdown I feel like I am *really* running out of things to write about...

Last night was another installation of the Guernsey Chess Federation's online blitz tournament offering, and after feeling like I ought to have done better than second last week, this
week I was able to rectify my previously erroneous standing in the results. Having put in a lot of effort over the past week, it was nice to see my hard work pay off, and I was very
happy with the way I played, winning fifteen games, losing three and drawing none.

With all that being said, I can't help but feel like I took the whole thing far too seriously. It was a virtual board game tournament with literally zero stakes after all... My
[Lent goal](/mendokusai/2021/02/17/lent){:target="_blank"} of not being so all-or-nothing apparently isn't going so well. Perhaps next week I'll take a different approach, and try
some fun new openings, only play for the most fireworkesque tactics, or beserk in all my games.
