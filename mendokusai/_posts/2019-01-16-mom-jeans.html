  Last night I got to see Just Friends and Mom Jeans life, and both were incredible.
  Watching the 10 piece ska-punk collective Just Friends all going nuts on stage
  in a tiny, sold-out venue that was essentially a pub was a heart-warming experience.
  Mom Jeans had tech problems and played without monitors and were phenomenal regardless.
  Gabe told truly awful jokes. Bart tuned Gabe's bass. Eric almost made me cry.
  Austin looked cute in the back, thereby fulfilling the entirety of his responsibilities
  as a drummer. They were perfect. Throughout their set, all I could think about
  was how purely, genuinely happy I was.

  Tonight I am exhausted and feel kinda sad, and tomorrow I have to go to work.
  But I know that in the future, I will have the same feeling as I had last night
  once more.
