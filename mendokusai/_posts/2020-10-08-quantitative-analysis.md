I really love the idea of quantitative analysis. It's results seem to be as close to predicting the future as mere mortals can possibly come - obviously machine learning is set to
overtake human quants imminently in fields where it hasn't already, but the robots live forever. I wish I'd been smart enough to be a quant, or perhaps if my academic career hadn't
been so hindered by my poor mental health (or the ill-informed decision to study law at university). Reading Five Thirty Eight's anaylsis of the [US election](https://fivethirtyeight.com/politics/){:target="_blank"} is just about the only way I can stomach ingesting information on the topic at the moment.

Hopefully one day I'll be a statistical wizard, with or without some kind of dream machine in my pocket (or, more realistically, in the cloud), and I can grow up to be like Nate Silver.
