After having a fairly long break from riding my bike due to another puncture, I've been trying to get back my confidence back this week. I still find cycling on my own absolutely
terrifying, I'm scared of both other road users and my own ability to stay on my bike. I have managed to cycle in both the rain and very heavy winds, so that's good, but there have
been some very sketchy moments, and I still can't really take my hands off the handlebars, which is pretty crucial in order to signal where I'm turning. I think all it needs is time
and practice, and I'm getting better at pushing past the anxiety that has prevented me from going out a few times before. My goal is to do a full lap of the island before the end of
the year.
