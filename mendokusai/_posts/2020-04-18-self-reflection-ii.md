Today has been another day of not-entirely-signed-up-for self-reflection. There's a million and one things in my mind at the moment,
but as I sit tiredly at my computer, I'm reminded that thinking is undeniably vastly overrated as a cognitive exercise. Listening to AJJ's
unrepentant brand of folk-punk blaring through my headphones, I am pretty over thinking for now, at least as much as it is possible to be.
For the foreseeable future, I'm only interested in being and feeling.
