Day one of new diet is in the books, not too bad so far. I am trying to keep things fairly loose and guilt free, so just gonna start for first month with a few simple rules and see how it goes.<br /><br /><ul><li>No liquids apart from water and coffee.</li><li>Feeding window between 12pm and 8pm only.</li><li>Try to minimise snacking, fruit where possible.</li><li>Try couch to 5k running programme (fml).</li></ul><div>Gl me.</div>
