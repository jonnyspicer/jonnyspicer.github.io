  I started watching Mad Men this weekend, and I've already made a pretty significant
  dent in the first season. Don Draper is a legendary character, and now I can
  see why. I am struck by how I think a great many men might aspire to be like
  him, despite the fact that he is a complete asshole. I refuse to be taken
  in by his charm and charisma, he is clearly devoid of any semblance of moral
  fibre.

<p>
  With that being said, clearly there is something admirable about him, and I
  think part of that is that he knows what he wants and he sets out to get it.
  I think a lot of people could learn from that - we spent ages agonising over
  what it is that we want, and then even more time lamenting the impossibility
  of acquiring it. The idea that want Don Draper wants is unobtainable has yet
  to occur to him. In that sense, I think it is a quality worth emulating -
  really, I do know what I want out of every facet of my life. I am simply too
  scared or ashamed to pursue or admit to it.

  So, perhaps I can channel my inner Madison Avenue executive, and set out to
  put myself first and get what I want. The good news is that I'm not in a position
  to be as recklessly unfaithful to my wife as my boy Don is.
