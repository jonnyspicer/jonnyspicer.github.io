title: Finishing What I Start

I am not particularly good at finishing what I start, whether that be courses, side projects, or "weight loss journeys" (I am however, *exceptionally* good at finishing off pints of
ice cream once started). Today I started a new AWS course that I intend to do at least partially in my free time, and part of me already thinks that I'll loose all motivation before
completion, even though I really, really would like to have this certification. I don't know why I tend to run out of steam with things, if it's come kind of anxiety or apathy, or
something else entirely, but if I do lose my mojo through this course then I'm going to at least force myself to have a long hard look at why, and try and figure out how to be one of
those people that finishes what they start in the future.
