Apparently I've not written a blog about Christmas, on Christmas before, so here it is. My feelings towards the holiday in general are mixed, I think it gets both justified and
unjustified stick, and I do think that the coming together of families everywhere is ultimately a great thing. Personally I'm not a huge fan, but a lot of people love Christmas, and
I'm genuinely happy for them that they do.

The food is usually a highlight, and this year was my first vegetarian Christmas. It didn't at all, and the nut roast I had felt warming and hearty after the chilly dip I took in the
sea this morning. I stuck to only a single drink because I have already been hungover far too much this week. I got a cool new jumper. Overall, Christmas wasn't too bad in the end.
