The UK underground's worst kept secret, and my personal favourite post/noise/math/experimental rock band [Black Midi](/mendokusai/2019/02/09/black-midi) have
finally released their debut album Schlagenheim. I had high expectations for it, but seriously, this thing is a masterpiece, a wonderful soundtrack to a chaotic
mind, groovy, energetic and weird in equal measure. It's certainly my favourite new album so far this year and it will be very hard to beat before the end of December
- immediate listening strongly recommended.
