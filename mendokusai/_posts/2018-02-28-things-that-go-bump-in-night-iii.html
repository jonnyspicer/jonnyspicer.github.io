<span >I did it! I watched all the way through <i>It.</i>&nbsp;Yes, the film was certainly scary in parts but, despite my nervous disposition, it wasn't the most terrifying thing in the world. It was also a great movie and I would strongly recommend it, but mostly I am proud of myself for conquering my fears and actually seeing it.</span>
