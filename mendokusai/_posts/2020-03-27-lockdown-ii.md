It's been a week of working from home and leaving my flat solely to exercise, bar one trip to the supermarket on Monday
which was intended to last two weeks. I was frankly expecting to be incredibly depressed by this point, and there is
certainly still plenty of time for that to happen, but at least so far I'm actually... not?

Some mixture of the improved weather, newfound extra time allowing for new acts of self-care in my routine, and extra
effort being made by a lot of my friends to keep in touch is keeping my afloat. Naturally I hope the pandemic can be
stemmed as soon as possible, but after this week, I'm glad that I feel somewhat more prepared to deal with the eventuality
that it continues for longer than we'd all like.
