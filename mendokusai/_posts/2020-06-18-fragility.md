I think a lot of us put a huge amount of time and effort into painting ourselves as being as un-fragile as possible. We lash out and hurt others as a way to somehow solidify our
own notions of durability. I'm confident we'd all be better off if we admitted our own fragility, and so I guess this post is me going first, for I am probably one of the most
fragile people I know. Every day feels like a late-stage game of Jenga, and honestly I think that's fine, trying to pretend otherwise is what is weird.
