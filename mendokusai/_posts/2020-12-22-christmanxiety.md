I will concede, it is not the best the best portmanteau in the world, but you get the idea. I always get pretty bad anxiety around Christmas, for a whole bunch of reasons, and it gets
progressively worse leading up the day itself, before dissipating back into nothing on Boxing Day. I thought I might get off lightly this year but in the past couple of days, it has
certainly kicked in. I also feel a lot more connected in it this year; I know a lot of other people are probably feeling the exact same thing I am, even if it's for different reasons.

Some people get excited for Christmas Day, but personally I can't wait for the 26th.
