It's been a few days and to be honest I haven't come up with any particularly interesting
goals, but still. If I decided on my 2021 goals in February, I feel like I'd have already
missed out on a whole month of progress, so here we go;

- Climb V5 in the gym
- Run a marathon (at this point it's looking very likely this will be solo). Also get my 50 parkrun t-shirt...
- Write 365 blogs; this is going to be the year of the blogging no-hitter
- Write 365 journal entries encapsulating 1095 things I'm grateful for. Repetition obviously allowed, maybe I'll do a bumper blog post with all of them in December
- Read 6 fiction books and 6 non-fiction books. Even if they're all spectacularly pretentious.
- Become proficient with Go (not sure how to quantify this one yet. When I start my new
job on Monday hopefully I'll be in a better position to set myself some professional goals)

It's a lot of exercise, reading, writing and work... But I'm looking forward to it. Most of
it. Not the last 10km of the marathon...
