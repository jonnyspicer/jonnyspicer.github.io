As much as yesterday I lamented the end of summer, today I was reminded that I actually quite like the autumn. I get to wear hoodies again, which are like being hugged all the time.
I sort of like the island in the fog - it makes me feel like I'm in Pirates of the Caribbean. I adore the sound of the rain on the roof and windows, when I am safely tucked up inside
and warm, I find it remarkably soothing.

So maybe the winter won't be so bad - I just need to find some kind of appropriate indoor exercise to keep me in shape both physically and mentally.
