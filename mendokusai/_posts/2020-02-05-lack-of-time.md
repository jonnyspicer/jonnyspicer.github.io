Once again I've not found enough time to be able to write properly about what has on my mind today, which I am a little frustrated with myself about. With that being said, here
is what is hopefully to come in the following week on the blog:

- Life, broken systems and the prisoner's dilemma;
- Poker;
- Clean Language;
- Kobe/Jacob;
- Saving people and saving oneself.

Now I have to dash to a social event which I organised, which includes an insane 14 person dinner reservation - almost certainly this is the biggest event that I have birthed
and coordinated myself. Don't these people have better things to do with their time?
