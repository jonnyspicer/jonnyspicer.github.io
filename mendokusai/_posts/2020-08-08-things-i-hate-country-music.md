On today's episode of Things I Hate is country music. I like to think of myself as relatively musically open minded. I like a lot of different kinds of music, and even for genres
I don't necessarily listen to very often, I either like some songs, or think that the genre as a whole has some redeeming features. Country music on the other hand, is beyond
redemption. It is terrible, in every way possible - musically, lyrically, capitalistically. I don't even have the energy to espouse its lack of value, so I'm going to let one of my
heroes, Bo Burnham, [do it for me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7im5LT09a0){:target="_blank"}
