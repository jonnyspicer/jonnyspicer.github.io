After not having tried any olympic lifting for several years, I went to a class today, in true Guernsey fashion being taken by the same guy who had already taught me to squat, snatch
and clean way back when. I had incredibly low expectations but actually surprised myself, I'm super weak but I have at least retained some modicum of technique.

I love the burliness of it; throwing something heavy over your head like some kind of animalistic trophy is a pretty nice feeling. I'm stoked to go again next week.
