  I absolutely <i>love</i> to hate popular things. Tropical house, Regina George and pumpkin
  spiced lattes can all suck my dick. I will usually completely forego any kind
  of fair judgment process for something if I knew it's well-liked by the masses,
  and skip straight towards loudly proclaiming my distaste for it.
</p>
<p>
  So, in the spirit of trying to not be as shitty of a person, today I wanted to
  talk about how much I love YouTube, and how I think it is a monument to the
  human experience.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly - YouTube has its problems. Its a subsidiary of Alphabet, so you
  bet they are gobbling your data. The site has an obligation to appease advertisers
  and copyright holders so they make a lot of strange and seemingly nonsensical
  decisions on those grounds, and in so doing threatening the livelihoods of people
  who rely on their platform as a sole form of income. There's a lot of weird,
  immoral, illegal shit on there. And it seems like there's a new bizarro world
  of Ukrainian content farms exploiting children for millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
  But, let's sweep those all under the carpet for a moment. I love YouTube as a
  platform. It educates and entertains me, and the ASMR videos on there literally
  help me sleep at night. Why do I hold it in such higher esteem than most other
  sites of its size?
</p>
<p>
  I think YouTube offers both creators and consumers of content far more freedom
  than other platforms. There isn't really a formula for success on YouTube the same
  way there is on, for example, Instagram (in case you were wondering, the formula
  there is to post airbrushed photos of your scantily clad, but perfect, body). The
  infamous 'algorithm', as well as advertising stipulations, naturally reward some
  people more than others, but channels of all shapes and sizes flourish. With
  the obvious caveat that this is all based on my personal experience with the
  recommendation algorithm and my own interests, I absorb content from 30 second
  glorious shitpost videos to documentaries over an hour long. I watch music videos,
  comedy videos, journalistic videos, review videos, podcasts, programming videos,
  lifting videos, gaming videos, chess videos, ASMR videos, and probably far more.
  Having all these interests in one convenient place, and getting recommendations
  for similar content based on my habits, is actually pretty neat.
</p>
<p>
  Of course what makes YouTube great is absolutely not the company or the website
  itself, it's the people on it. Sure, there are literally millions of people
  churning out hypergarbage every day, but there are a surprisingly large amount
  of really wonderful, funny, insightful, enriching channels that aren't unnecessarily
  difficult to find. The oft-feared comment section is admittedly laden with naysayers
  and unwell-wishers, but there are plenty of corners of the site which feel like
  an actual <i>community,</i> often formed around a group of niche channels, where
  people are not all total assholes to each other. If you look hard enough, you
  can find these pockets of resistance, where people are actually people and not
  monsters. And I like that.
</p>

  Give it a few more years and I'm sure it'll have all gone to shit though.
