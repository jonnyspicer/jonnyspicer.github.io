This site has finally undergone some minor, but much-needed cosmetic surgery. A quick changelog:

- Header is now a lovely shade of blue and is a bit more in keeping with the way most headers look. It expands wider than the rest of the page so it's not quite so cramped, the spacing is better, and the mobile version has been cleaned up also;
- The footer is an equally lovely shade of blue;
- Those weird green/brown colours are gone, and I used a much less drab colour picker to get some new highlight colours, including this rather fetching <a style="cursor:default">pink</a>;
- All the fonts have been changed;
- Excerpts of posts have been added to the front page;
- You can now view the next/previous post without having to navigate back to the blog pages;
- There's a new favicon that denotes me as a lazy piece of shit who sleeps all day, rather than someone smart.

Overall, I'm happy with the changes and for only ~2 hours work they represent some solid quick wins. Even though I was only recently talking about rebuilding the site in NextJS/node with a microservices 
approach, now I am using .NET in my day-to-day, it only makes sense for me to rebuild it using Razor Pages, meaning this is likely the last time I will make any meaningful updates to this edition of the 
site. 

Hopefully I'll be able to find the time and motivation to get stuck in to the new build, stay tuned for updates!
