<span >I really feel like I am running out of ideas for what to write here. My days are much the same, not a lot new happens, I think all the same thoughts, and I don't really want to write any more depressing entries. So I guess some random positive thoughts from today:</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Overwatch League has continued to be really awesome, I am excited for this week's matches.</span><br /><span >The start of NALCS was pretty cool, Doubelift is someone I have admired for years and to see him do so well is awesome.</span><br /><span >I am really enjoying listening to the music of both McCafferty and Car Seat Headrest at the moment, and excited for their new albums this year. I really wish I was as good/bad at dancing as Will Toledo.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3NPATRzaF00/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NPATRzaF00?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br />
