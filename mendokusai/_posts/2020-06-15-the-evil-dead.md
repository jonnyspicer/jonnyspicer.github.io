This weekend I finally got round to watching Sam Raimi's 1981 cult horror classic *The Evil
Dead* and oh boy, it is absolutely deserving of it's mythical status. I wish I could have
watched it back in its release year so I had a better context for it, both in terms of tone
and effects, but I still adored it.

It is ridiculous, totally over-the-top in a way that is archetypal of classic horror films
(this film obviously playing a big part in cementing the archetypes of its era), unapologetic
in using violence as a way to generate a reaction from its audience. There is no subtelty
to it, and its wholehearted unashamedness is largely what makes it so good. The peculiar
camerawork (the camera never appears to be parallel to the ground in any of the shots) is
a big part of what makes certain scenes genuinely unnerving, but the tension is all but
released when the demons themselves are actually displayed on screen. The bit with the
tree (if you've seen the film then you know which bit I mean) certainly seems a good way
beyond poor taste given an extra 40 years of social context, and frankly it's hard to
see how it was acceptable, let alone advisable, back then, which did mar the film
overall for me a little.

Despite this, the film does an excellent job of achieving its stated aims on a very
small budget and with an impressive laundry list of production problems, and is
deserving of its cultural relevance and impressive legacy. A must watch for any
goofy horror fans.
