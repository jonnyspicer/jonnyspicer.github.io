Everyone knows weight loss and the internet is a total minefield, a plethora of multi level marketing schemes,
tummy tea influencers and opaque motives galore, but in my (admittedly inextensive) experience, peer support weight
loss communities on the internet are their own unique flavour of weird. The crowd sourcing of emotional support by
a group of people who inherently share some kind of shared neuroticism already feels like a dicey proposition, and
you don't have to look very hard to find guidance or input from others that seems unlikely to be mentally or physically
healthy for anyone involved.

I'm not sure I really have a positive note to end this one on. The internet is a scary place sometimes.
