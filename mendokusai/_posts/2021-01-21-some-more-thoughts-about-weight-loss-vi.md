After complaining about it not two days ago, stepping on the scale this morning yielded a meaningfully lower weight for the first time since stopping drinking and trying to exercise
more/eat less. For a split second I was really pleased with myself, a feeling which was immediately replaced by being frustrated at myself for caring so much about something as
poor a measure of personal worth as my weight on a scale.

Inevitably I'm going to weigh myself tomorrow as well though, and I'll care what the display reads too. At least I might actually be making some progress now, rather than just slamming
my head into a metaphorical wall for nothing.
