  Just a quick one today as I am off out momentarily to drown a year's worth of sorrows.
  Before I go, I must implore you, dear reader, to take some time and visit
  <a href="https://idlewords.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">idlewords.com</a>,
  the blog of Maciej Cegłowski, whose name I cannot even come close to
  pronouncing.
</p>
<p>
  His writing style is truly impeccable, and an absolute joy to read. I have
  devoured a slew of his posts on topics I wouldn't have considered myself
  the slightest bit interested in, simply because of how enjoyable it is to consume
  his words. Despite his Polish name suggesting otherwise, his immigration to the
  United States aged only 6 years old means his grasp of the English language is
  superior to any other individual I can think of. Go. Read it. Now. Throw away
  your 'classic' literature, because Cegłowski writes your canon now.
