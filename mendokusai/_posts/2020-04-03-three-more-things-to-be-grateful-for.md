title: Three More Things To Be Grateful For

After a rough couple of days, some more things that I'm grateful for seem like they'd be useful to segue into a more positive weekend;

- I'm grateful for Ted for putting in the work to get tags working in our Jekyll blogs, and submitting his pull requests to me;
- I'm grateful for the sea, for always putting things in perspective;
- I'm grateful for the lady at the checkout in the Co-op today who pointed out that the ice cream which I'd only bought one of us was in fact on offer, and I could get twice as much for the same price.

The first two are alright, but to be honest the third one *really* made my day. Also be sure to check out tags now they are finally working!
