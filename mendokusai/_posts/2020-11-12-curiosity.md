On this week's episode of *things my therapist says to me*, we have a pretty simple one; be more curious about other people. I have talked a lot about narcissism and depression before,
and it's something I worry about in a lot still, that too many of my interactions with people are too focused on myself. After so many years of seeing everything from my perspective,
I am pretty over it, and ready to try to understand other people's better. When I struggle to feel connected with people, often despite spending a lot of time with them, perhaps this
lack of curiosity on my part could be the problem. It's something some of my friends are especially good at, and something I'm going to try to emulate more myself.
