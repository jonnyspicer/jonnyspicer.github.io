The line between self care and self pity seems worryingly thin. One seems important, and one
seems unhealthy, so it's an important distinction to make. Is self care in excess a form of self
pity?

I don't really know, all I know is that I am going to be watching a film in bed at 6:30pm on this
Friday night under the pretenses of self care, so fingers crossed I'm not wallowing in anything else.
