  My out of office is on for the next week. Knowing this is an <i>
  excellent</i> feeling. To celebrate, I decided to have a couple of
  beers and enjoy an evening of watching Youtube videos and doing nothing
  productive (apart from writing the post), totally guilt-free.

  After catching up with my boy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gustoonz">
  Gus Johnson,</a> the infamous algorithm recommended by a video from
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Om9kAkl32dWlDSNlDS9Iw">DEFCON,</a>
  the hacker conference in Las Vegas. Back when I was 14, I thought it would
  be amazing to be a h4x0r, and so I knew the general schtick behind the event.
  The title was suitably clickbait-y, and like any dutiful millenial, click I did.

  And it was excellent. A few hours later, and I am firmly down the rabbit
  hole. I now want to hack every single IoT device I can find. I want to
  script a twitter bot. I want to script that script, so I have an army
  of twitter bots. Having recently learned that Chrome 70 is implementing
  the Web Bluetooth API, I want to do the most obnoxious things possible with it.

  I don't think I have really earned the right to comment on "hacker culture"
  or "the hacker mentality", but I have huge admiration for the way in
  which the speakers at DEFCON went about solving their problems.
  They tried anything and everything, inside and outside the box, reshaping
  the box, redefining the box, heating and freezing the box, calling
  the box a cuboid just to see if it made any difference. They never
  gave up, even in the face of seemingly unsurmountable difficulties.
  In the end, they often did some good, in a roundabout way. And the
  whole process seemed a lot of fun.
