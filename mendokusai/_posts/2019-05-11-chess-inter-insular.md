Today was the 82nd installation of the Channel Islands Inter-Insular; the annual chess match between Guernsey and Jersey, in recent years played 
across 16 boards. Jersey could only field a weakend side, with many of their top players regrettably absent, which paved the way for a historic 
occasion (for me at least) - my first time being part of a winning team since 2010, our board two getting his 2nd individual win since his debut 
in 1983, and Guernsey's biggest margin of victory since 1965.

I only managed a draw against my opponent who I would consider myself a favourite against, but as things transpired a loss would've been a fairer 
result so I am glad I was able to salvage a vital half a point, and furthermore do a job for the team.

After last year's particularly upsetting loss where I felt somewhat responsible for Guernsey's overall loss, I was immensely grateful to be able 
to redeem myself this year, and the pride I feel at the drubbing we have handed our island counterparts is one I will not soon forget. All that remains 
is to slowly crawl up the board order for the next few years until I have a shot at becoming Channel Island champion.
