While following the Tory leadership contest in the news in the past few days, I can't help but notice how almost without exception, each candidate
has made a point of emphasizing that they will be the leader capable of keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of 10 Downing Street. Now, I understand that party politicals
has an advantages, and perhaps I am being a bit of a naive millenial, but should keeping the opposing party out of government really be so high up everybody's agenda?
Couldn't you like, just all work together to try to improve the slew of issues facing the country? Just a thought.
