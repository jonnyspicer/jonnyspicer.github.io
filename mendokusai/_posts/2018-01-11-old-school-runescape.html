<span >I first played this game back in elementary school, so I guess I was 10 or so, and took my first internet screen name from it. It came out in 2002, and 16 years later it still holds up, and is a lot of fun for me and hundreds of thousands of others. I wonder what makes a piece of art/entertainment stand the test of time in an age of exponentialism.&nbsp;</span>
