Lockdown has reached the stage where I am only interested in filling my time by binge watching mindless trash on Netflix,
and so a rewatch of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia seems like just what the doc ordered. There's 14 seasons of this
thing, it goes on forever. Every episode has broadly the same premise, so you don't really need to be paying much
attention at all, in fact you can easily be playing Dungeons & Dragons on the side. Netflix doesn't even seem to bother
to ask me if I'm still watching anymore - it's just as resigned to this as I am.

It's Always Sunny sought to be a different kind of sitcom, namely by making all of its characters wholly and
irredeemably deplorable. Every single one is a petty, selfish, emotionally immature egomaniac. It's not wholesome
in the slightest - a lot of the jokes are unacceptable by today's standards, and probably raised eyebrows back
when they originally aired, but the point they were making was always that being intolerant was stupid to the point
of being laughable.

IASIP is really one of those warm, comforting, hot-chocolate-and-a-duvet-on-your-sofa-on-a-cold-winter's-night kinda
shows. I can't wait to plough through the remaining 11 seasons before the month's out.
