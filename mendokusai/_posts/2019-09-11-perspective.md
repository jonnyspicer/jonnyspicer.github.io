A balanced perspective has always seemed like a noble goal to me, something worth striving for. Sometimes one seeks out this new
viewpoint and sometimes it is thrust upon you wholly involuntarily, indeed often unpleasantly so. Even in the latter circumstance,
I think it's important to try and use it as a force for positive change, particularly if you were already questing for it through
other means in the first place.
