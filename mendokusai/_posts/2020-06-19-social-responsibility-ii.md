This is maybe the third or fourth attempt at writing this blog...

On my mind today; as someone with a lot of privilege, I feel a responsibility to both educate myself on and talk about the issues that stop other people from having the same privilege
as I do. If people like me don't take an proactive part in those conversations, things won't change, as we are the problem.

On the other hand, I don't want to say the wrong thing, or for the wrong reasons. I want to be informed enough to say something persuasive and meaningful and un-ignorant, but I'm not,
at least not yet. I don't want this to be performative, to be a way of absolving myself of my own guilt, to make me feel better about myself, or to be all about *me*. I'm not very
good at that either.

More, hopefully better, thoughts on this soon.
