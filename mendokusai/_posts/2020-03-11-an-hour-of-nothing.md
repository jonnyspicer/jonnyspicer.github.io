First off, I am attempting to write this post in nano, and if that doesn't make me a real developer then I don't know what does.

Secondly, this week I am trying out a new rule for myself (rule sounds a little bit draconian - let's call it a *heuristic* instead). Every day I have to spend a whole hour
doing something unproductive. No work, no exercise, no cooking, no cleaning, no writing a blog post, no nothing. A whole hour of being a vegetable in some way, shape or form,
contributing nothing whatsoever to society.

I'm very excited about it.
