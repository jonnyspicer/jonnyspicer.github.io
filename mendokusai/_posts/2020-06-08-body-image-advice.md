All body image advice on the internet, as far as I can tell, boils down to these three things;

1. Don't go on social media;
2. Eat better;
3. Exercise more.

In a lot of ways, I think these are probably pretty good routes to go down, and are all things that I'm trying to do
currently to feel better about my body. I do think they are all difficult in their own way though - staying off social
media is FOMO galore and eating better and exercising more are the same two pieces of advice you'd give to somebody
who wanted to *change* their body rather than become more at peace with the one they already have. As the body positivity
movement gains more traction, I hope we can see better advice for learning to love what's in the mirror right now,
and maybe if I come up with anything that works for me I'll post it here.
