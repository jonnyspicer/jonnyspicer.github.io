I'm about to begin the 6000km journey home, and I won't get there for 30 or so hours.
I'm probably not going to sleep in the interim, I certainly won't find a bed,
I'm a bit hungover and likely to be exceptionally tired for most of the trip. It's
definitely going to suck, but it was also without a doubt, 100%, categorically worth
any kind of pain for the amazing two weeks that I've just had.
