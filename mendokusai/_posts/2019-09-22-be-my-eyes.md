Recently I've found myself thinking a lot that it might make me happy to help other people in
some way, and that I should look into volunteering or find some other way to make a contribution. When push has come to shove, I have done some Googling but not yet made any
meaningful commitment to doing anything, partly out of fear and partly out of complacency.
I am hoping one way to bridge this gap, and begin to leave my comfort zone, will be with the
help of [Be My Eyes](https://www.bemyeyes.com/), which I downloaded and signed up for today.
The app's premise is very simple - it allows blind or partially-sighted people to connect with
fully-sighted volunteers over video call, so they can provide assistance with any kind of task
that the former might need help with. It's simple, it's quick, and I can do it straight off my
phone, but there will be enough anxiety involved that I think it'll be a meaningful endeavour
for me.

I'll write back once I've taken my first call.
