It's been a Joy Divison kinda day. I think Unknown Pleasures is one of the greatest albums ever created, and I've binged it all the way through a couple of times already since
waking up. It's so hauntingly beautiful, in a way that offers a lot of help; things suck now, but they'll be better in the future. Obviously, they tragically didn't get better
for Ian Curtis, but much like Kurt Cobain and Nirvana, perhaps his early death served to cement his musical legacy for future generations. I love the iconic pictures of Ian, or the
videos of him dancing in his impossibly gawky way - he looks so trapped inside his body, desperate to get out, and it shows a lot in his music too.
