Tomorrow is not the first day I have ever worked from home, however it marks the start of the first extended stretch
of working from home (at least that I have had while working in software). I thought it'd be interesting to write
down some of my expectations and plans on how to stay sane in the upcoming months.

Firstly, I've tidied up my desk, which previously was a huge mess. Admittedly all that really means is that I've
relocated the mess elsewhere in my apartment, but at least my working area is now clean.

Secondly, I plan on having work clothes and not-work clothes - essentially the former are jeans and the latter anything
but jeans. I hate jeans. But I think wearing them will be a nice way of mentally separating between the two modes of
existence.

Thirdly, routine and exercise I think are going to be crucial. I'm going to try and keep up running as much as possible,
as well as do some kind of at-home workout, even if it's only a couple of sets of push-ups each day. Having my productive
hours as 9-5 like usual and trying to have some kind of pre-work and post-work ritual are all parts of the plan.

Fourth, a common piece of advice seems to be to overcommunicate with your team - tell them when you're at your desk working
first thing in the morning, when you're taking a break, what the best way is to contact you, what you're working on today,
etc etc. That seems like quite a lot but I'll do my best; I'm sure I can easily tone it down if it's too much. I'm also
obviously going to try to be as social as possible, as I'm sure we all are, to try and stave off loneliness in our
seclusion.

I'm both excited and apprehensive about quarantine; on one hand, I think I could potentially be very productive from
home given the lack of people to distract me, as well as the extra flexibility I'll have. I'll be able to cook hot
lunches for myself, or go for a run on my lunchbreak and have a shower on my return, options I wouldn't have at the
office, and my hours can also be more flexible.

The flip side will of course be lack of human interaction and how that'll affect me. I don't think there's any point
dwelling on it though, as it's not llike I have a choice; I'll just have to do my best.
