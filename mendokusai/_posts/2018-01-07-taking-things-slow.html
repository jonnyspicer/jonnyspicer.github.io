<span >When trying to make positive changes in my life, I often want to do everything at once, to wake up tomorrow and make a whole bunch of drastic lifestyle changes and somehow just try really hard to make them stick. But that is obviously dumb, even though I try it every time. So this week, my only goal is to try to eat and sleep well, and then next week if that goes well I can work on something else.</span>
