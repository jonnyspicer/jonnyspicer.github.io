I watched the Disney Pixar film Inside Out tonight, on the recommendation of my therapist. I enjoyed it a lot, although watching an entire film while trying to work out what
the therapeutic applications of it might be was a new and slightly strange experience for me. Obviously, Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith of The Office fame) resonated the most with
me, which definitely wasn't the point - the point was that we all have a number of different emotions, and that they are all valuable and exist for a reason. We function best as
humans when we don't obstruct these emotions, and allow them to take up and cede space as necessary. Only when all one's emotions are in harmony, can you be a balanced, happy person.
Or at least, I think that's what the movie was getting at, hopefully I wasn't reading too much into it.
