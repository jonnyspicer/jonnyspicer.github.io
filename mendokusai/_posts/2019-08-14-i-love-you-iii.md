It's nice to be right about things, and [back in May](/mendokusai/2019/05/03/i-love-you-ii) I was indeed right about how I would feel
this week. It's important that some things are said, and all that's important is that you say them, not what they might be met with.

But equally, hearing it back is a pretty special feeling too. I hope Mica finally got what she wanted.
