Yesterday, Larian Studios [announced Baldur's Gate III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcP0WdH7rTs), 19 years after BGII was originally released.
The original games were some of my favourite ever (in fact I already [mentioned them earlier this week](/mendokusai/2019/06/05/day9-daily-10)) and I
am *unbelievably* excited to finally make my return to the Sword Coast. With fifth edition AD&D rules in place for the new title, hopefully some of
the more weird and wonderful kinks in the old school gameplay will have been ironed out and the randomness will have calmed down.

In a time when it's becoming increasingly more difficult to be positive about AAA titles, I am incredibly optimistic about this one. Larian are a great
studio, even though we haven't seen or heard much so far, what little info has been shared looks promising - after all, Mindflayers are one of the sickest
D&D monsters out there. What old friends (or foes) will return? I'm sure Minsc and Boo will have at the very least a cameo, but what about Jon Irenicus or
Sarevok? Will it carry on from the events of Throne of Bhaal? Only time will tell, but this is a great excuse to start my millionth playthrough of the old
games this weekend.
