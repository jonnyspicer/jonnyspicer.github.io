<span >Today I finished writing a pretty long piece for my main blog, on my time playing poker and my future. It's over 2k words long, and I am immensely proud of it, in fact it might be my favourite blog post that I have written so far. I think it strikes a good balance between being funny, self-aware, honest and genuine. If you would like to read it, you can find it here:&nbsp;<a href="http://jonnyspicer.com/2018/04/19/the-dream-is-dead/">http://jonnyspicer.com/2018/04/19/the-dream-is-dead/</a> and I hope you enjoy it.</span>
