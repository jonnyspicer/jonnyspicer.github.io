I was reminiscing earlier today about the opportunity I had to play chess in Dubai - more specifically the building in which I got to play. The Dubai Chess & Culture Club centre
is in the shape of a giant chess piece - a white rook - which sets it very far apart from any other tournament venue I've come across. The air conditioning was top notch, a welcome
relief from the heat outside which I was not well equiped to handle. The boards were inlaid into the tables, which were stunning beautiful and a joy to play on.

I might be biased, but I think *all* chess venues should be like Dubai's...
