  I'm sure I have decried the concept of New Year's Resolutions in the past, but
  now I am older and supposedly wiser, I think they're actually pretty great. Sure
  - if you want to change your life, start now. But we all get trapped in cycles
  of habit - January 1st is a good opportunity to take a step back and evaluate,
  to try to set yourself onto a new path.

  I have failed at so many things in my life. There are so many goals I have set
  over, and over, and over again, seemingly oblivious to the many previous defeats
  I had faced. For the past couple of weeks, I have pondered whether it's worth
  setting the same goals, or any goals at all. Am I being naïve by saying I want
  to lose weight, improve my self esteem and become more connected to people?
</p>

  Who cares if I am. Naiveté is great - it gives me hope. Ignorance of potential
  negative realities of my situation is blissful. I don't want to give up on my
  idealism and by the same token I want to keep believing that I can change, even
  if I haven't managed it on previous occasions.

  My resolution last year was not to kill myself, and hey, I fucking nailed it.
  so I'm gonna up the ante for this year. I'm gonna lose weight and get jacked,
  I'm gonna improve my self esteem (but not as a result of losing weight and
  getting jacked) and I'm going to become closer to the people around me. Bring it
  on.
