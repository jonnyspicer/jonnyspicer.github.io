Our ISP is down, island-wide. This is only making it's way to Github's servers because my
computer is tethered to my phone's 3G connection. What do people do when they have no internet? It's barbaric, inhuman, a denial of my rights. You can't even facetiously
tell me to go outside, because actually I've already been outside all day thank you very
much, but now the sun has set. I'm going to have to read a book or something, FML.
