  Until very recently, I have tried my utmost to avoid politics, but since 2016,
  it's been impossible not to. Today I was absolutely glued to the live reporting
  over the Prime Minister's Brexit deal and its far-reaching ramifications.
</p>
<p>
  It was utter carnage. And I kind of enjoyed it.

  I am obviously young but this kind of total lack of political control is not
  something I've experienced in my lifetime and I suspect neither have my parents'
  generation either. Everybody seems after their own skin. Nobody knows if Theresa
  May will remain Prime Minister, whether there will be a general election,
  whether there will be another referendum, whether there will be a deal or no deal
  Brexit or even a Brexit at all. May seems to have garnered very little support
  for her current deal, and everyone seems keen to tear it down, but few are
  putting forward alternatives. It's a childish, embarrassing shitshow for the UK.
  Like a car crash in slow motion, I am unable to look away. Perhaps we will see
  total anarchy. Dissolution of the government. Riots up and down the country.
  Maybe I am privileged to be alive during the pinnacle of modern western society,
  before it collapses and devolves into a recapitulation of the dark ages.

  Good luck everybody.
