<span >My emotions feel disproportionately strong compared to how long they last. One day I feel intensely unhappy, and the next carefree and joyous, with no significant events in between. Our emotions are the products of our situation, but seem so precarious, nothing more than a good night's sleep will drastically change them. What is the point of these emotions then? I need to get better at noticing them without reacting to them.&nbsp;</span>
