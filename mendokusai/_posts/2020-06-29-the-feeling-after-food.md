I've been trying another little gimmick recently in order to improve my relationship with food, but I quite like this one. Whenever I make decisions about whether or not
to eat something, a big factor in those decisions is how I feel in the process of eating said thing. My new idea is to try to instead thing of the feeling after
having eaten the food - the feelings are very often opposite.

I dunno if it'll stick, and I'm still eating plenty of sugar etc, but now at least I seem to moderate those things a little better. We'll see how long it lasts eh.
