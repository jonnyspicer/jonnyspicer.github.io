<span >I went for a run today, and I can't remember the last time I did that, it could easily be over a year ago. In retrospect, going with a competitive mid-long distance runner was potentially a mistake, given I pushed myself far too hard. After running 2.5km in 15 mins (which I was actually pleasantly surprised with), I had to stop... and then I had to sit down... and then I had to lie down... and then a couple of people pulled over to ask if I was alright. Fortunately after a few minutes on the ground I was fine, and even ran some of the way back home. It was weirdly fun despite being very uncomfortable for a lot of it.</span>
