One of my friends is having a rough time right now, and I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to best support him, what responsibilities one's friends have and where appropriate
boundaries for a friendship might lie. In some sense, what he's going through is self-perpetuated, if not self-inflicted, but equally I don't have all the information, and from what
I do have, I think I'd do exactly the same thing were I in his shoes. It's not so clear at what point I should step in and bluntly tell him he needs to make a change for his own sake,
if indeed that point ever comes, but equally it's awful to see him this way, and I might regret not saying something in the future.

Friendships are hard, but I guess that's what makes them so rewarding.
