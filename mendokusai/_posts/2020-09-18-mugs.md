My first 'real' job out of university entailed working for a sports betting syndicate, which naturally prodcued some interesting stories. One of my favourite (and also one of the most
publishable) anecdotes from my time there was from when our boss was staying with his mother in the UK. While trying to join a remote discussion with the team, and check some odds
as naturally bettors are want to do, he messaged us to say;

> There's a block on gambling sites on the WiFi here. I'm not sure if it's for the grandkids or because she thinks I'm a mug*.

*A mug is a gambler who consistently loses.

It still tickles me to this day - I love the idea of a mother still preventing her son from gambling on her home network, even if he has proven that he can make upsettingly large
sums of money doing so.
