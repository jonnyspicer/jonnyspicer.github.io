OK so somewhat low hanging fruit when it comes to a) blog posts and b) things that might be beneficial to one's mental health *but* I am currently so tired I can't even really see
properly, which is clearly not conducive to feeling great about life, the universe and everything. Sleeping better seems to have the biggest effect on my day-to-day happiness of any
single parameter, although I still don't give it the priority that it accordingly deserves (as I suspect is the case for a lot of people). I remember Magnus Carlsen saying in an
interview once that he always tries to get 9 hours of sleep a night, and that blowing my mind a little after hearing the oft-touted figure of 8 hours being optimal for many years.
He is a much smarter person than I am, so tonight I'm going to follow in the footsteps of one of my childhood heroes and also try and get a solid 9 hours.
