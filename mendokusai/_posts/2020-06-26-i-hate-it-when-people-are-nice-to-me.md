title: I Hate It When People Are Nice To Me

I think I've talked about this before, but equally I can't find it, so here it is again.

Whenever people who are not my close friends are genuinely nice to me, I kinda hate it. It creates so much cognitive
dissonance between their actions and my low self-esteem. There's also some level of meta-discomfort because I know
that disliking people being nice to me is dumb.

Anyway, too many people were nice to me last night and it made me skin crawl, I'm super excited to stay in tonight and
not run the risk of repeating.
