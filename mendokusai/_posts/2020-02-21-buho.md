Tonight I'm going to a fancy Mexican restaurant. Only, the thing is, as someone who can now pretentiously claimed that they lived in Mexico briefly, I know there's no such thing as an
*authentic* fancy Mexican restaurant. If it isn't fried in 3 pigs worth of pork fat and served
to you by a 400lb, 5'2 Mexican lady who clearly hates you because you're white and your Spanish
sucks, then it simply isn't legitimate Mexican cuisine.

Fortunately, fake-ass fancy Mexican is still *super* tasty and the tequila tastes the same either
which way.
