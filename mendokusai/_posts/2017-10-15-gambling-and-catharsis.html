<span >The problem with living with another poker player is that there is altogether too much gambling in the air at any time. Freerolls, prop bets, credit card roulette, crossbooks.... not including the obvious, that we play poker all day every day. I mention this only because that's my excuse for why I'm writing this, hoping you have an equally good one for why you're reading it.&nbsp;</span><div><span ><br /></span></div><div><b><span >The bet</span></b></div><div><b><span ><br /></span></b></div><div><span >The three of us living together have to post a public blog post every single day, without fail, and once somebody fails, they give the other two $100 each. The remaining two continue, until there is a clear winner, at which point the runner up ships him another $100.</span></div><div><span ><br /></span></div><div><b><span >But why?</span></b></div><div><b><span ><br /></span></b></div><div><span >It wasn't my idea, but the point is that writing thoughts and ideas down every day is healthy for a number of reasons. Catharsis, practise of a skill, a way to track your progress, keep yourself accountable, some cheap laughs at the ignorance of your past self.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span ><br /></span></div><div><span >I learned from the best at prop bets, so I'm excited, but don't expect much.&nbsp;</span></div>
