One of my favourite qualities in other people is when they can leave me completely 50/50 as to whether or not they are joking. There are a couple of my friends who can do it uncannily
well and leave me totally baffled, and I think it's such a cool skill to be able to walk this particular social tightrope so effectively. I'd like to get better at it - maybe I'll try
and write some blogs in that vein, and leave it up to you whether they're sincere.
