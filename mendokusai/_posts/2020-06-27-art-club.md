A couple of my friends have got really into watercolour painting over quarantine, and invited me over today to join
them for an impromptu "art club". 

I haven't painted anything since dropped Art back in Year 9. Today, I remembered why 13 year old me made that abundantly
logical decision.

It was fun though, even if the result was completely indiscernible eating a box of Froot Loops and then vomiting them
all over a piece of paper.
