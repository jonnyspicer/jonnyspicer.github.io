  In only the third post on this blog, I wrote about
  <a href="/mendokusai/2017/10/17/radical-honesty" target="_blank">Radical Honesty.</a>
  I talked about about Radical<i>ish</i> Honesty, which I am now going to call
  Radish Honesty for short, and how I thought it would do me good to try to embrace
  it. Well, over one year later, I have done a bad job of that, so it's time to
  revisit it.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, I have become somewhat convinced that a big part of my potential future happiness
  will come from being more honest and open with the people in my life, about
  how I am really feeling (eg actually tell people when I'm depressed and how bad it is).
  I am hoping that talking more about my 'true self' or whatever will help me
  feel more connected and help my overall mental health.
</p>
<p>
  The problem is... if I am employ Radish Honesty with the people around me, I
  more than likely going to be a bit of a Negative Nelly. My friends are going to
  ask me if I'm alright and I'm going to say 'no' and then spontaneously burst
  into tears. I feel like that might get old fast though - so what am I going to
  do?
</p>
<p>
  I'm pretty scared if I follow all the self help, therapy bullshit advice of
  'be yourself' and 'be vulnerable' and blah blah blah, that I'll just be a
  burden, the miserable friend nobody wants to be around. My poor mental health has
  become a worryingly large part of my identity and personality, and now I don't
  know what else is left. We hear it a million times a day - 'surround yourself
  with positive people' - but I'm not a positive person. What if nobody wants
  me around?
