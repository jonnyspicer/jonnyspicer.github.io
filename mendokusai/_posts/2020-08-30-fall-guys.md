After both not having played many video games recently and also been stuck with the feeling of not knowing what to do to have fun when I have free time to myself, I picked up Fall
Guys, the bubblegum battle royale party game from Mediatonic. It's everything I want in a game these days - easy to dip in and out of, challenging but always fun, a game which
won't make you think but will provide a welcome distraction from the outside world. It's also quite nice to enjoy the same thing that everyone else is enjoying, for once.
