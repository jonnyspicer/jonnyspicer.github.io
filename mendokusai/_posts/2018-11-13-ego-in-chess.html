<p>
  I've always been a very competitive person, and accordingly I love winning while
  loathing losing. To that end, I have usually had something relatively adrenaline-filled to
  fulfill my need for competition, be it fencing, esports or poker over the years.
  But in the last few months, I haven't been doing much of any of those things,
  which temporarily created a bit of a hole in my life.
</p>
<p>
  I have played chess pretty seriously for over a decade now. I still <i>enjoy</i>
  winning at chess, but I don't have quite the same thirst for it I do in other
  arenas - there is so much inherent beauty in the game that I can still enjoy a match
  which ended in a draw or even a loss. Chess has never been ego-fuel; I've never
  fist pumped after an overwhelming sacrifice or roared in celebration upon delivering a brutal
  checkmate.
</p>
<p>
  However... For the most part I have liked everyone that has played in the chess
  league with me. They are by and large kind and intelligent people, and I have
  had no problems with them. This season though, there is a new player in my
  division, who has just moved to the island. I don't want to speak too ill of
  him for the sake of it, but... I do not like this man. He is rude and arrogant.
</p>
<p>
  We played in the summer (less serious) version of our league and we drew - he
  actually gifted it to me really, he ought to have won. I was pretty annoyed
  about it afterwards. He was my first opponent for the winter (more serious) league
  a couple of weeks ago. Usually when I am mentally preparing to play chess, all
  I am aiming for is to play a good game, one where I don't make any stupid mistakes,
  hopefully some interesting positions which will be enjoyable to analyse. I try to
  avoid having any expectations about the outcome. This was
  different though - I wanted to win, really badly. I wanted to crush him, as if he
  was one of my old fencing partners (I was always desperate to be the best when I
  fenced at school - I was a comically bad loser) or a fish that had just stacked
  me after they got it in awfully OTF in PLO.
</p>
<p>
  Before our match he did not do a good job of dissuading me that he deserved to
  not be annihilated. He made a rude and unfunny joke to one of the other players
  who was clearly exceptionally stressed. He was very ill, and told me he would've
  re-arranged, but because he would've given me less than 24 hours notice, he didn't -
  he "wouldn't do that to me". Well thank you buddy - you're really a hero for sitting
  opposite me so blatantly full of a virus that not only did you make playing you
  an unpleasant experience, I dread to think what manner of airborne diseases I
  contracted off you. But thanks for 'not doing that to me' and still showing up -
  you're a real hero!
</p>
<p>
  And... I did it. I crushed him. Sure he was ill, but even so - it was embarrassing.
  The game was over in just 18 moves, his position had already been decimated. He
  showed a clear lack of understanding of the opening and I punished him for it.
  I don't want to brag too much (I already think writing a blog post about how great
  one of my own chess games was is a pretty deplorable act), but he didn't even
  play <i>that</i> badly - he essentially made 3 inaccuracies and according to the
  computer, I managed to play near-perfect for those 18 moves. It might be my
  favourite game that I've played to date, and it felt really, <i>really</i> good
  to win.
</p>
<p>
  Tonight I am playing an entirely different player, a late middle-aged accountant
  and veteran of the club. He is always sweet and lovely to me and I have nothing
  bad to say about him whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
  But I am going to beat him so badly he regrets ever learning the rules of the game.
