Today is the first time in a long time that the blog has a new feature, one which is long overdue (but equally is probably
on the verge of extinction too) - an RSS feed. Its sister sites have had pull requests to add the feed opened as well, so soon
you'll be able to get notified about posts from the whole gang.

While I have previously written off RSS as a thing of the past, recently I wanted to subscribe to [polly.gg](https://polly.gg) and
apparently Github doesn't let you watch repos in such a way to receive an email every time there's a commit. Adding in RSS functionality seemed like the perfect way to do it, and now if you'd like you can
also add this site added to your favourite reader and be notified every time I publish something.
