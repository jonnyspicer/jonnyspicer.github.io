Quarantine has broken me. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm burned out of using my PC altogether. It's
the only thing I do and I am *so* sick of sitting in this chair and staring at these screens. I need something new to
do in my free time, and perhaps the void is unfillable. I guess I'm going to have to do something lame like read books
or draw.
