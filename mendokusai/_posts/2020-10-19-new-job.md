Having handed in my resignation today, I can finally talk about the fact that I have a new job, and a bit about the process I went through to get it. There were definitely good bits and
bad bits, and I'm going to stretch it out over more than one blog post. I've found the whole thing to be incredibly stressful (unsurprisingly), and honestly it's been one of the most
stressful experiences in my life, so I'm very happy I can take some time to relax and enjoy my achievement. I also haven't found writing here particularly rewarding, or felt like my
posts have been of a particularly high standard recently, in part because of said stress, so hopefully that will change in the next couple of weeks.
