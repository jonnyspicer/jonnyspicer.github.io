  As part of a marketing thingy at work, our whole team got asked for some examples
  of people we look up to in the indsutry/regard as 'gurus' in their chosen field.
  I think a lot of the ones on my list were somewhat obvious and unoriginal choices,
  but here they are regardless:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brendan Eich</li>
  <li>Yan Zhu</li>
  <li>Linus Torvalds</li>
  <li>Jen Simmons</li>
  <li>Troy Hunt</li>
  <li>Addy Osmani</li>
  <li>Vitalik Buterin</li>
  <li>Brian Kernighan</li>
  <li>Dennis Ritchie</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Did I miss anyone obvious?
