I am exceptionally lucky in that I get relatively palatable hangovers. Past some muscle soreness and dehydration, I don't really get the crippling headaches that seem to afflict
others. On one hand it's great, because I can still have a sort of normal day after a night of heavy drinking, which I am enjoying today. On the other, I don't ever really get
punished for poisoning myself and so don't learn from my mistakes, meaning I have the opportunity to do it all all over again tonight...
