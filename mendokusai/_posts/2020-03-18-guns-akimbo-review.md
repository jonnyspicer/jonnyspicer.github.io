After presumably having made more money than one human being could ever spend in a lifetime, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have
decided that he is only going to do ridiculous, goofy, *bad* movies that are entertaining to him, and frankly, I think
that's great. *Guns Akimbo* certainly satisfies all three of those adjectives. The writing is bad, and whenever it
appears to err into self-awareness, it course-corrects back to obliviousness near instantaneously. I'm almost certain
it employs the exact plot to at least seven other movies. To its credit, some of the VFX and sound is pretty good, and
Radcliffe's performance just about makes it hang together. Oh, and it has Rhys Darby in.

If you love bad movies, and even moreso bad movies with Daniel Radcliffe in (a niche that is rapidly growing) then you'll
love Guns Akimbo. Objectively; 3/10. Subjectively; 7/10
