Today English indie pop-rockers Bombay Bicycle club released their first full length studio project in 6 years, "Everything Else Has Gone Wrong". I was going to write a review
of it but I'm too tired, and feel plagued by the sense that reviewing art is pretentious and arrogant anyway, but I will say I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it heartily.
The album's theme is that while its protagonist's life is collapsing around him, the one thing keeping him going is love, hence its title. It's a message that feels overwhelmingly relattable to me today, but I'll try to write about why over the weekend, once I've had some sleep.
