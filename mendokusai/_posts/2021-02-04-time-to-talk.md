Today is [Time to Talk Day](https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/get-involved/time-talk-day){:target="_blank"} here in the UK and while attending a related webinar at work today, it got
me thinking that while I am getting a lot better at being the one doing the talking, I'm nowhere near where I want to be when it comes to listening. Picking up on the signs that
someone might be struggling, knowing how to initiate a conversation with them about it, and then giving them the time and space they need to have a meaningful conversation about it are
all difficult parts of the process, and all areas I want to work on. I'm plenty good at centring my own thoughts and feelings (as evidenced by the fact I have a blog with however
many posts on now) but my sense of empathy still needs a lot of work. Given the strain the pandemic is putting on literally everybody's mental health, it seems now is the perfect time
to start practising.
