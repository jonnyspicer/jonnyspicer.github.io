It feels like another one of those days when writing about anything other than America is to wilfully ignore the elephant in the room. I don't have a good take on it at all, I think
all there is to say is that it seems unfathomable. Having spent my entire life ingesting so much American media, I think myself and many others in my generation (and maybe
beyond that as well) view America as the pinnacle of Western society. Or, at least we did, until 4 years ago, and now, the fall from grace seems complete; it's distressing to see
such horrific injustice and such a catastrophic failure of the systems which jurisdictions closer to home seek to emulate.
