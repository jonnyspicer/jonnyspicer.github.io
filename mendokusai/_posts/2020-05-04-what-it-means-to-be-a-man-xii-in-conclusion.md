Good news - this is the last part of the series! For now at least. I promise tomorrow I will actually write about something
completely different.

So, after two weeks of thinking and writing, I've found 10 potential hills to die on. I know they still need work so
I'm not 100% ready to commit to them yet, but they seem like a good starting point nonetheless. They are;

- Responsibility;
- Honesty;
- Humility;
- Unashamedness;
- Persistence;
- Non-Complicity;
- Patience;
- Acceptance;
- Self-Respect;
- Empathy.

They all need work, some of them more than others. Some are typical, obvious traits, but I think at least a couple
have slightly more nuance in my mind as to how I think they should be embodied in a person. The hope is that by having
a written list of qualities to aim for, that will make it easier for me to conduct myself in such a way as to attain
them, and in the process build my self-esteem.

It's undoubtedly not going to be as easy as that, but hey, I've gotta start somewhere.
