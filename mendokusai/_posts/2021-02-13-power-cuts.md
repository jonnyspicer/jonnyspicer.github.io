We suffered a power cut this afternoon, and fortunately our electricity is back now, but it was an unpleasant couple of hours. With the heating off and the temperature hovering around
freezing, I had to wrap up in bed to to try to stay something vaguely resembling warm. I briefly panicked about whether I was going to be able to upload this blog, and cruised through
a few chapters of a book, even though I had rather hoped to get some work done this afternoon.

Obviously it was at most, a minor inconvenience. But it was also a nice reminder of the things that, even amidst a global pandemic, I take for granted.
