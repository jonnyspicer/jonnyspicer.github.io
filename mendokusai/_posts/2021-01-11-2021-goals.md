While talking to a friend yesterday, I remembered that usually at the start of a new year people set goals, and I haven't. After the year that 2020 was, I'd imagine a lot of people
are eschewing any kind of lofty goal setting exercises too; I think we're all just hoping to survive 2021 and praying some semblance of normality returns soon.

But, in the spirit of optimism, and hoping this year is an improvement on the last, perhaps it would be nice to set some goals. Come back tomorrow to see if I came up with any good
ones!
