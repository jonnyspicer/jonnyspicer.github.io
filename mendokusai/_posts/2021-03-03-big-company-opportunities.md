One of the things I am loving about working at a large company is that there's
so many cool events in the calendar I can just show up to. Last week we had a
talk from the CEO of a VC company invested in us, and he shared some of his
wisdom on our company, the industry, and the world at least. Considering his
wealth he was surprisingly down-to-earth and humble, and reminded me of Bill
Perkins a lot. This week I've already attended a workshop data pipelines (which
was open to the whole company), and a meetup for engineers (all 174 of us) where
several people presented and I got to learn about parts of our stack I have
yet to touch as well as some helpful tools and general tricks. There's a two
hour React workshop that I'm half considering attending. Next week we have
a speaker coming in to talk to us on International Women's Day about getting more
women into STEM, and tech in particular.

I'm incredibly wary of companies that try to market themselves as "families" to
their current or prospective employees, and I think on principle I'm never going
to let myself feel that way. But it is nice to feel like my company is its own
*community*, and a pretty good one at that.
