This part of the year is always well and truly my least favourite. I eat too much, I drink too much, I mess up my sleep schedule, don't do anything productive and lose my routine. For
some reason, I do the same thing every year in the name of taking a "break" from responsibilities, work and health, and every year it makes me feel miserable, but I do it anyway. This
year so far has been no different. I can't wait for normality to be back, to be working again, for the days to get longer, for the rain to stop, to stop drinking, to be exercising
regularly again. Hopefully next year will be different.
