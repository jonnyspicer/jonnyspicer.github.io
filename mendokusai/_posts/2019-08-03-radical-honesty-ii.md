[Radical Honesty](/mendokusai/2017/10/17/radical-honesty) has been both on my mind and my lips a lot recently. After having conversations about it with some of my favourite people in the world I think I am onboard with it than ever - perhaps
still not full-blown, yes-you-do-look-fat-in-that-dress honesty, but certainly [I-love-you](/mendokusai/2019/05/03/i-love-you-ii) honesty. The kind where you have difficult conversations when they're important,
even if you're nervous, the kind where you're unashamed to tell someone how you feel about them, the kind where you have no secrets, you own everything you say, do and feel. The expected value is off the charts.

So, now the blog is back, I'd like to recommit myself to writing uncomfortably, painfully honestly here.
