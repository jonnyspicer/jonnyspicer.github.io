Honestly maybe I won't ever write about anything else, these feel much better than complaining about something or other.

1. Not having a tapeworm. I listened to a podcast about them today and honestly - what. the. fuck. I'm going to have nightmares tonight, but at least during my
waking hours I can be grateful that they are not a part of my reality.

2. Chess. What a great game, an insurmountable skill ceiling, with so much depth that you can easily use 100% of your brain on it and escape into another, simpler world.

3. The pissing rain in the middle of June when it's meant to be sunny. To remind us to appreciate it that little bit extra when (if) it actually *is* sunny.
