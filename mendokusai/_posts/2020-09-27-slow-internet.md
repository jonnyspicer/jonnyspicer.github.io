The worst thing about living at my parents' place so far; the internet here sucks. I did not realise how accustomed I had become to pages loading in under 10 seconds. Perhaps I'm going
to have to spend less time on the internet...

Also I'm exhausted and have an awful headache so sorry you're not getting anything more exciting to read today :(
