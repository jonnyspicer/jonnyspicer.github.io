Again, I don't especially want to write about this, but I also don't have enough time to think of anything else, so here it is. The race has finally been projected, Biden is
unofficially the next president of the United States of America, and Kamala Harris the next Vice President. The bad dream that has been Donald Trump seems like it might finally be
drawing to a close, and his voice will no longer echo across the whole world. Twitter even hinted it might shut his account after he's no longer President. It is a victory of sorts
for liberals everywhere, but while Biden might be progressive compared to Trump, he's still not exactly progressive. Hopefully this is a stepping stone moment for the loudest
global superpower, and not a time that it will rest on its laurels.
