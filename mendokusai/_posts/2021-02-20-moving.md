I will be shortly moving to the mainland UK, and I am conscious that the imminence of my departure is likely to sneak up on me. There's so much to do in the meantime; on top of the
obvious things like finding a new place to live, I also need to get a new phone contract, open a new bank account, register for the NHS and apply for a National Insurance number. Not
to mention the logistics of actually moving to a place a plane-ride away, made all the more stressful by doing so in the midst of the pandemic. I'm trying to do a little bit every day,
to chip away at my to-do list, to maintain momentum without allowing myself to be overwhelmed by trying to sort everything out while still holding down a full-time job.

I know once everything is sorted, it will have absolutely have been worth the effort. But right now, it's stressful.
