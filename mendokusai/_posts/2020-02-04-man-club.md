Firstly I lost the bet - oops. Fortunately Ted is a degenerate and instantly accepted to run it twice, and so now I am going to
Martingale the fuck out of him.

Yesterday I attended the local men's support group, descriptively titled "Man Club", for the first time. In a social clime where
historical masculine archetypes have been labelled as toxic and deemd to be unbefitting modern men, we have been left bereft of
gender identity, with naught but a void in our psyche where stoicism once was - which is a little ironic when you think about it.

Perhaps I am over-egging it, of course being a man is still, in many ways, fine and great. But still, I think myself and a lot
of other men are quite disillusioned with their own gender roles and places within our social structure. The idea of men's groups
is becoming more acceptable and appealing, and a men's movement is gaining traction and legitimacy in our collective consciousness.

The experience reminded me both of the GTO club and of group therapy, two things where I felt deeply connected and accepted by a
group, and two threads of treasured memories. It was incredibly raw and vulnerable, in a way in which men aren't in our day-to-day
lives, and of course that is one of its stated aims.

It's intense, but I'm hopeful about it.
