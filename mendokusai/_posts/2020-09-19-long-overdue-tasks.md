Today I finally got round to accomplishing something that's been on my to do list since March, namely getting my new graphics card working. It's not like I didn't try at all to install
it in the last 6 months, it's more that I just hadn't tried especially hard on any particular occasion, and had subsequently procrastinated for periods of several weeks after being
unable to solve the problem straightaway.

I do really wish that I'd just got it sorted when I first got the card. But, having put it off and off and off for so long, the weight that has lifted now the task is complete is such
a glorious unburdening that it almost feels worth all the interim cognitive energy spent not doing it.
