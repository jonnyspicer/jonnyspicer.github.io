<span >I finally got to catch some of week 1 of Overwatch League this week, and so far it seems to be a huge step towards legitimising esports. I was skeptical about Overwatch as a competitive game for the last year, it never seemed to get the viewers and just generally had a bunch of problems, and Blizzard's plans for OWL seems far too ambitious in my eyes, but I am glad I was wrong. Each franchise bought in for $20m USD, the broadcasting rights were sold to Twitch for a reported $80-90m, the league's principal sponsors are HP and Intel.... Some of the type broadcast talent from a variety of different games were brought in so the casting lineup is amazing, and on the first day, the league had half a million concurrent viewers, which is nuts for simply a league and not a world championship event. It's awesome to get to watch the Korean gods play every night too, Saebyeolbe and Ryujehong are so much fun to watch.</span>
