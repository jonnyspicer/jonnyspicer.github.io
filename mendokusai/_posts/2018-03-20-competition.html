<span >This skilling competition has really shown how far I will go to win at something. 15 hours today of the same repetitive thing on my pc, planning the rest of my week around how to maximise the hours I can put in, going to pull an all night on Saturday to try to play from 6am Saturday - 12pm Sunday and lock up the W. Wtf is wrong with me.</span>
