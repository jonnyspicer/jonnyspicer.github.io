  One of the strangest and most distressing characteristics of modern Western society
  (and likely other societies that I am not so familiar with) is its ability to
  ensure its participants feel psychologically trapped by some cycle therein.
  It could be a relationship, a job or career path, a sexuality, a gender identity,
  or any one of the innumerable other norms which we feel overwhelming pressured
  into conforming towards.

  I certainly feel trapped by these things. I had a clear path laid out by my
  environment from birth, and the rigidity of it has been slowly suffocating me
  ever since. Upon reflection, my feeling of entrapment seems obvious in my past
  writings, even if it wasn't explicitly acknowledged. Last month alone I mused
  about <a href="/mendokusai/2019/02/16/what-we-want" target="_blank">setting out to
  get what I want, </a> <a href="/mendokusai/2019/02/19/the-grass-is-greener" target="_blank">
  my contempt for using 'the grass is greener' as a means of oppressing hope</a>
  and <a href="/mendokusai/2019/02/21/re-an-honest-living" target="_blank">whether
  a change in collar would make me happier.</a>

  I have struggled with identity for years - I take no pride in my background, I
  am scared of becoming like many of the people around me, I do not feel like I fit
  in, in a hopelessly self-aggrandizing, why-can't-you-see-everyone-feels-like-that-you-dick
  kind of way. I feel trapped inside the path that's set out for me, and one of
  my biggest fears is that I will die within its confines.
</p>
<p>
  I've also spent some time contemplating and talking with friends about 'the goal'.
  You know, the biggie. The one that goes on your tombstone. I've felt particularly
  unsatisfied with my lack of answer to that existential question, but perhaps
  this is perfect - the dream is to feel truly free. To break out of any sense
  of obligation to those around me, to do what I want, to express myself honestly,
  to no longer be constrained to work 50 hour weeks behind a desk and live the 2.4
  kids lifestyle.
