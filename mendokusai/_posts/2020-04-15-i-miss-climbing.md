Just a short one today because I had a million things to do today and it's super late, the next edition of Leetcode solutions
will be coming probably at the weekend when I have more time.

Of the things that I am struggling with in quarantine, not being able to climb is surprisingly prevalent among their
number. For a relatively recent hobby it seems I fell in love with it fairly quickly (probably the effect of enjoying
a beginner's rapid rate of progression), and it fills the void left by fencing at the intersection of physicality
and the cerebral. Hopefully when this is all over I won't have too much strength, I can't wait to spend hours in the
gym at the next opportunity I get.
