Having been loosely invited on a trip to the US in March (somewhat irresistably to Vegas specifically), I feel a little torn. Part of me of course wants to have something to look foward to, to hope that the trip will go ahead after having cancelled so many plans this year, to have a goal to aim towards. Another part of me of course is still feeling the disappointed of said former plans, and is reticent to allow myself any expectations of future travel in order to avoid further disappointment.

In theory I think you want to have the lowest expectations possible, but the highest hopes, however in practice struggle to separate the two. So I am going to allow myself the *tiniest* amount of
expectation in order to permit myself a nourishing amount of hope - hopefully the US gets its
act together in the upcoming months :)
