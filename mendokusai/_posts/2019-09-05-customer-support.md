I have been embroiled in a particular arduous customer support debacle with a certain company since March. I am tempted to name and
shame them, but to be honest I just want the matter resolved, and perhaps then I will throw them under the bus. I've not been
sure how to handle it - the whole ordeal has been exceptionally frustrating for me, and I would love to vent this frustration at someone who I felt was suitably at fault. Unfortunately, I don't feel like any of the customer support representatives I've spoken
to have been the ones at fault, and I am acutely aware that they are already the undeserving targets of many customers' ire, even
without mine being added on top. I'm doing my best to be level headed and understanding with them, and hopefully earning myself some
points as a stellar human being in the process.

Equally I just want my shit fixed already, how hard can it be?
