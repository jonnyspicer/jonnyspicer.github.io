Not a particularly revelatory one today, but I've been using aeroplane mode a lot on my phone recently, and I really like it. There's a sense of calmness I feel as soon as I switch it
on which belies far more about my relationship with my phone than I would like. Taking back some amount of control over something that clearly has a lot of control over me is a good
feeling, and if your relationship with technology is as poor as mine, I'd recommend trying it.
