<p>
  My last therapist insisted that alcohol was bad for my mood. He said that it was a net negative, and hangovers/the depressant effects the drug has would ultimately make it a net negative on my mental health. He was obviously a super intelligent guy who knows what he was talking about. But... in my own observations I don’t agree with him. I woke up this morning after an only moderate night of drinking by my standards, sleep deprived and with a painful headache. I had four coffees today and tried to cram as many electrolytes back into my bloodstream as possible. I was meant to go running this morning but couldn’t face leaving the comfort of my room. And I still wouldn’t change a damned thing. I would take any hangover for the opportunity to socialize with lesser anxiety when I’m drinking. So, cheers I guess.
