Today was my last day as a web dev for the small company that I've worked for over the past year and a bit. I deliberately 
don't talk much about my job on here, but I would be remiss not devote one of these daily posts to some of the amazing 
people that I have had the opportunity to work alongside. After leaving my first full time job at the end of 2016 
relatively straightforwardly, in fact barely even saying goodbye for anyone, I was not prepared to for some of the 
emotional farewells I had to face this time round.

It was a great reminder both of my own ability to form meaningful connections with others, and of people's general wondrousness 
that I felt such a strong bond to some of my colleagues despite us never necessarily talking much about our personal lives. 
Evidently the shared experience of solving problems together, overcoming issues large and small, bouncing back from failure 
and celebrating success was enough to make me feel very strongly. I really was not expecting to find myself feeling as sad 
as I did to say goodbye to my colleagues. It was a very humbling experience, but I am immensely grateful for it.
