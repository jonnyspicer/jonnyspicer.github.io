  In exciting news, this weekend I managed to fix my previously documented
  <a href="/mendokusai/2019/01/28/os-installation-issues" target="_blank">
  dual boot OS installation issues.</a> Frustratingly, all I had to do was run
  the Ubuntu installer again with all my drives connected (which I'd already done
  once - or at least thought I had), and this time there were no bootloader issues.
  I guess the classic developer tactic of try-the-exact-same-thing-again-
  and-hope-for-a-different-result actually worked this time.

  Because I'm too tired to write anything interesting, here's a list of the
  first things I installed:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Guake</li>
    <li>Atom</li>
    <li>Apache</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
    <li>PHP7</li>
    <li>Pip - apparently this didn't come with the Python3 installation on Ubuntu?</li>
    <li>Jupyter</li>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Jekyll</li>
    <li>NPM</li>
    <li>Compiz</li>
    <li>create-react-app</li>
    <li>Docker</li>
    <li>Spotify</li>
  </ul>
</p>
