title: Ten Things I'm Looking Forward To Moving For

While I was in the process of applying for jobs, I didn't really allow myself to look forward to living in London, even though moving there was a large part of the reason that I was
even looking for a new job. I am still somewhat reluctant to think about it, given I don't know when I'll be able to move, and I don't know when things will be back to normal there
either - getting my hopes up feels dangerous, like I might be tempting fate that the pandemic still has a good couple of years left in it yet. With that being said, I think we all
need something to look forward to when we get back to "normal", whenever that might be. So, here are ten reasons I am excited about moving to London.

1. Being able to go floating whenever I want
1. Being able to go to world class climbing gyms
1. Being able to go to world class tattoo artists
1. Things being open 24/7
1. Being able to eat any kind of food, from anywhere in the world
1. Being able to travel easier, so I can go see my friends in faraway places more often
1. Being able to walk down a street and not be worried somebody might recognise me
1. Falling in love on the Tube, ten times a week
1. Being able to get on a train and go somewhere entirely different for the weekend
1. Being able to see bands I've actually heard of play live
