Yesterday I managed to [hack the first box](https://www.hackthebox.eu), that being the invite code for Hack The Box. I say 'hack' in the loosest sense of
the word because I have no idea what I was doing (also every step was basically the most obvious thing to try). Now I'm in, and I've spent a couple of hours
getting Kali set up (for the third time, yawn) in a VM, the VPN is configured and I can start attacking actual targets.

Except I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. Writeups coming later, if I ever do manage to get into anything.
