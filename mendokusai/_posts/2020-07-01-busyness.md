I've only been back in the office for a couple of weeks, and already it feels like everything is back the way it was before lockdown. Work has gone back to
dominating my time from Monday to Friday, and I feel so *busy* constantly, in a way in which I didn't feel during quarantine. I used to feel like I had extra time
to try new things - now I don't feel like I have enough time to fulfill my existing obligations. My own little world appeared to keep turning during lockdown, perhaps
its time to take a loot at what steps can be taken to become less busy even while working from an office.
