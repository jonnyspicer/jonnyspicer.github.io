In [This is Water](/mendokusai/2020/05/25/this-is-water){:target="_blank"} DFW describes how he felt the concept of
college teaching him *how* to think seemed a little insulting, given that he had passed a rigorous entrance process
that supposedly demonstrated that he in fact already knew how to think. As I already touched upon in my previous
blog, he instead says that the benefit of college is that it gives you the ability to chose *what* you think about,
and that's what's been on my mind today.

Given his struggles with depression and ultimate suicide, I think DFW knew well that of course, it's not as easy as
just choosing what to think - thoughts are often forceful, unruly things. I know that my own way of thinking follows
a very familiar, well-worn pattern, and have become more and more aware recently (thanks to the perceptiveness of
others) of my own tendency to get stuck and to spiral downwards. I think and think and think, I catastrophize, I
dwell on that which I don't have and not that which I do, microscopically analysing anything negative in my life
until the point that it has been magnified so much, it's the only thing I can see in front of me.

I do have some choice what to think though. Even if I didn't finish my college education, I think for me, all I need is
awareness that the option of autonomy over one's thoughts exists, in order to have it available, and I'm lucky that
that's the case. It's not easy - I've been in the same pattern, all day every day, for many years - it's had time to
bed in. In those moments, shifting my thoughts first requires an awareness that they are toxic, and then a deliberate,
conscious effort to not engage with them and instead with something else. And then three seconds later, another, similar
effort, because I have already veered back into the whirlpool of destructive thinking. And then again, every 3 or so
seconds, for the entirety of my day in which I am conscious.

The fact that it'll be difficult is not reason not to try though. I think meditation is helping me a little (I think
I'm on a circa 20 day streak currently), really it is practising doing exactly what I've described - thinking something,
acknowledging that thought, and then choosing to think about something else instead. I think if I could break my old
habit and form this new one, I could be a lot happier, and that means I have to try my hardest to do it.

So, from now on - all my thoughts are getting audited. Are they healthy? Are they productive? If not, then I'm evicting
them from the space between my ears.
