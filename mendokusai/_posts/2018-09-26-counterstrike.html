<span >Following the Major this weekend, I am loving playing Counterstrike at the moment, even though it is oftentimes stressful and frustrating. I am about to stay up too late tonight in order to play it, which seems very childish, but if I'm not staying up late to do something that makes me happy, what am I really doing?</span>
