  Today I finally listened to elusive UK post hardcore/noise rock wunderkinds
  black midi (not to be confused with the post-modern genre of electronica).
  Even though I just tried to do so, they style of music defies labels and is
  difficult to pin down, eschewing the confines of a particular genre. Take
  the best bits from Cap'n Jazz, Fugazi, and Tera Melos, and I think we're
  starting to get a vague approximation of black midi's sound.

  Recently I have been lamenting not having any bands I especially want to make
  the effort to go see live, after ticking off Mom Jeans and Car Seat Headrest
  last year, but now I have surely found the next group I will make a pilgrimage
  to watch. They aren't most people's cup of tea, but if you like weird music,
