One of my least favourite things about my own taste in music is that it's hard to find songs to sing along to with other people - and I really love being able to sing with someone besides my steering wheel. A lot of the really popular songs of the day that
other people belt out with nostalgia kinda passed me by, and now I'm left at at best whistling the tune and at worst unable to do anything but bob my head to the beat. Maybe I will
binge listen to some 00s pop classic playlists on repeat for a couple of weeks to try to get my knowledge up to scratch.
