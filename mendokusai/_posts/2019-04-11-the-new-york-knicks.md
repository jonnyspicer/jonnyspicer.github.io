Last night we saw the Knicks get battered by the Pistons at Madison Square Garden,
in what I thought was going to be a 40 point game for most of the night. Fortunately
by the fourth quarter the Pistons were cruising and so the Knicks managed to save
at least a little bit of face, at least when it came to the scoreline, and despite
it certainly not being the highest quality basketball game I've ever seen, it
was a lot of fun.

Drinking warm, upsettingly overpriced beer through a straw, jeering at Andre
Drummond after he missed an easy dunk, being transfixed by the half-time entertainment -
all parts of the quintessential American sporting experience. The stadium itself
is incredible, and while I assume the atmosphere could certainly be a lot better
(people were leaving in droves by the third quarter), I was still buoyed by the
enthusiasm and optimism of the Knicks fans. Hopefully next time I see them,
they'll be able to put up more of a fight!
