<span >I'm so tired and my body hurts, I feel like I am getting sick, probably due to lack of sleep, junk food and alcohol. My bottle of whiskey is almost empty which is pretty sad. But tonight I am going to do it all again, bigger and better than before! Seeing old friends is amazing, I take them far too for granted. I can spend at least one more day and night saying that I will deal with my problems tomorrow instead of now.</span>
