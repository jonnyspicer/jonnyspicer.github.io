  Having a strict schedule, where I get up and go to bed at the same time very day,
  and can plan my time around my routines, has helped me a lot recently. Last night
  and today my schedule has been knocked off and it has thrown me for quite the loop -
  so today just a short post and an early night. Sweet dreams, friends.
