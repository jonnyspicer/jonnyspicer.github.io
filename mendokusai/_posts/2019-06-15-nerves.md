I've probably already written about this before, but many years ago I heard the following from a top British fencing coach:

> If you're not nervous about it, it's not worth doing.

The saying has stuck with me ever since, and it must've been a good 10 years since I heard it. I was pretty nervous about today, and it turned out to be worth doing,
and I am pretty nervous about tomorrow also - hopefully it turns out to be similarly worthwhile. Nervousness is an odd feeling - in a way it feels bad, but it also
seems very possible to lean into the feeling, embrace it and channel it into something positive.

Anyway, wish me luck for tomorrow!
