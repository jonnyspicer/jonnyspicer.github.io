I'm a runner now. I bought some shoes, I downloaded Strava and smashed out a 5k training run - my first ever 5k not on a treadmill. I'm not really sure if I find 
it fun yet, especially because the last 2km were determined much more by psychological rather than physical factors, but the satisfaction of being in significantly 
better shape than I thought I was has spurred me on to go again tomorrow.

Kipchoge here I come.
