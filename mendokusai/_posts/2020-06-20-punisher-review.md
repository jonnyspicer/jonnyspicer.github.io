Phoebe Bridgers is rapidly becoming my go-to artist to have a cathartic cry to, and her latest
full length album, *Punisher*, is a perfect addition to all my sad playlists. Released
yesterday (ahead of schedule), I've already listened to it all the way through a bunch of
times. Bridgers effortlessly blends the pain of depression and heartbreak with a sort of
bleak hope, all in a raw, mellifluous package. A beautiful, moving piece of art, well worth
a listen if you have a box of tissues handy. 8.5/10
