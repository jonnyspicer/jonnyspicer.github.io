Shame is something that both I and I think men in general deal with awfully, frequently with
disastrous consequences. When your gender identity is so driven by ego, anything that might
tarnish that is inevitably swept under the carpet, and becomes a source of defensiveness
and pain. Shame is such a strange and unique negative emotion as it can damage us so much,
but it is perhaps the only one that can be willed out of existence by its owner. Admitting
one's faults has so much healing potential but is something that for some reason, men have
just collectively decided we're not prepared to do, even if it hurts all of us and all
the people around us in the process. It's... well, it's fucking stupid is what it is.

Men should take pride in their weaknesses, weakness being inextricable from being human.
There are a handful of men that come to my mind when I think about being unashamed, and
they are all almost there, but I think the one who is closest is Fat Mike, singer and
bassist for maybe the greatest melodic punk band ever. Despite being 53, arguably past
one's punk rock prime, he still dies his hair crazy colours, wears a dress on stage,
and sings open about his depression, thoughts of suicide and drug use. He even does so
without pretense, he isn't peddling a sob story or trying to stay relevant when many of
his peers have moved away from the punk sound or given up music altogether, it comes across
as authentic. Perhaps it helps that Fat Mike clearly has some pretty deep flaws, but his
willingness to engage with them publically certainly endears him to me (and seemingly a
lot of other fans given the longevity of NOFX), and I think makes him worth holding up
as an example of how to be a good man.
