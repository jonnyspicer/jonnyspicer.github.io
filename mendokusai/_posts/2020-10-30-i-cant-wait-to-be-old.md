I'm still young, and absolutely want to do my best to make the most of the opportunities that my youth affords to me
while I can. With that being said, I am very excited to be old (and by old, I suppose I mean a few years into
retirement age, if I get there), because there seems to be some kind of age threshold past which one simply
stops caring what others thing of them.

Obviously I would like to be able to tap into that power now, but it seems so much easier said than done that
it is in fact impossible. So, fingers crossed there is a switch that flips in my head one day, even if that day
is a few thousand away from today.
