Today was my first day in the Digital Greenhouse, Guernsey's premier coworking space, and the first time I've had the opportunity to use one since 2017 in Playa Del Carmen. The Mexico
office, Nest, was by all accounts a weird little place, although I enjoyed it a lot, I think the DGH compares pretty favourably. First of all, while both places offer free coffee, now
I also have access to *free hot chocolate*, which in these single digit temperature days is an absolute game changer. Nest featured a selection of self-styled *digital nomads*, the
novelty of which wore off pretty quickly, especially due to how loud they all were, and the relative peace and very British restraint of the DGH is a welcome change.

Oh and the plumbing is functional, so that's nice. I miss my coworking buddy from Nest though ðŸ˜¢
