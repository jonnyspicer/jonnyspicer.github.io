By which I mean, I'm inheriting a website and I'm pretty excited.

It is the [Guernsey Chess Club Website](guernseychessclub.org.gg) and yes, it
is old AF. The URL was registered in 1997 and I think it's reasonable to assume
that the site has undergone minimal work since, which in a way I actually love -
it is a relic of sorts.

I've recently been inspired by a certain cathédrale, and relics can be burned,
so sadly I'm not sure how long the site will last in its current iteration under
my stewardship. I have grand designs on a rebuild, but porting some of the features
(that are all pure custom build with no framework, I believe in Classic ASP) into
a modern CMS is probably going to be a not insignificant challenge. I'm hoping
that it will be an enjoyable one though, and the chess club has given me a lot
over the past 12 or so years that I have been attending, so I am excited at the
prospect of being able to give something back.
