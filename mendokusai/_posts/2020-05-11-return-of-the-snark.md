As of last night I've given the site a new lick of paint, and I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out. I think it looks less dense than before, subtler and more refined, elegant and
ultimately more readable, which is the sole objective of a blogging site. I also rewrote a lot of the copy, on the home page, the [about](/about){:target="blank"} page and the blog intros.

For however long now (I guess roughly a year) I've had copy there that intentionally avoided self-deprecation, and I attempted to come across as positively as possible. And I hated it,
every time I read it I would cringe painfully, I couldn't even make it through my whole about page without having to take a break to suppress my nausea. It wasn't my thoughts, it wasn't my
voice, it wasn't me, and I don't really know why it took me so long to change it.

And so now, we're back to the snark, the attempts at humour where I am the butt of the joke. I don't really believe that portraying myself this way is bad for my self-esteem, because it feels
so natural, the words feel like my words again. I like trying to be self aware and funny, even if I do a questionable job at both. It feels like these pages show my personality again, rather
than some kind of sterilised doppelg√§nger. It wasn't helping my self esteem to talk about myself like that at all, if anything it was making it worse, I just felt like a fake.

It feels good to stop pretending in one little facet of my life.
