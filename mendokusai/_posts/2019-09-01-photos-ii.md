After having mused back in April that [perhaps I should reconsider my stance on pictures], today I would like to fully admit that I used to be wrong about them. Photos are great - it's forced smiles that aren't,
so the trick is not to force them. In the past few weeks I've been struck by a certain amount of remorse that I've not taken more pictures of my summer, with my friends and loved ones. I can think back to the moments
I shared with them and smile, but I have looked at the handful of pictures I do have a hundred times over, they make it all the easier to transport myself back to that moment and tap into the feeling I had then.
I'm definitely going to take more pictures in the future, and complain less about having them taken of me. You've still got to tell me a joke beforehand though.

I can't write a post about pictures, especially one about their merit, without sharing [this set from today's CSGO Major.](https://twitter.com/borodasltv/status/1168183163425906689) apEX and kennyS are former teammates, now competing on different rosters, with the latter having been eliminated from one of the biggest tournaments of the year, while the former had progressed against different opposition. But really, I don't even know if any of that matters - these truly are worth a
thousand words.
