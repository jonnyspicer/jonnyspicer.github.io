<span >After procrastinating installing an SSD I bought for 4.5 months, I finally got round to doing it yesterday, even if it was the hacky-est hardware installation I've ever done. Please don't look inside my machine, it's embarrassing. But at least it <i>works</i>.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >After some struggles (including having to walk to town to buy a flash drive large enough to write an OS to), I managed to get Kali up and running. There was a fairly prolonged moment of terror when it announced that it was rewriting the entire disk I had given it, and I was significantly less than 100% sure I had selected the correct one, however fortunately on this occasion I hadn't fucked it up.&nbsp;</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Linux is a whole new world for me though and it'll take me a while to get up and running... for example I have installed Brave but am unable to run it, as apparently you can't run it as the root user for some reason... Either way, I am excited to learn about what Kali can do.</span>
