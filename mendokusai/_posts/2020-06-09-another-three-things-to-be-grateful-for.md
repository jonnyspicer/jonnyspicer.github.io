Instead of writing another fairly empty post on days when I don't feel like writing one, I think it'd be better for everyone involved if I tried to channel some kind of
positivity into my writing here, and so here are some more things that I am grateful for today.

1. The fire alarm going off in public places, assuming nobody gets hurt or suffers anything other than a minor inconvenience. Hear me out on this one. The alarm went off in
Waitrose today, and it was absolutely glorious. Nobody knew what to do, customers sheepishly looked at one another while some tried vainly to continue shopping. There was no
sense of, uhh, alarm, until we were all eventually coralled outside like lethargic, mostly-retired livestock. I love this kind of chaos - people invest so much effort into
keeping up the appearance of cool calm composure, so to see feathers rivaled en masse was a wonderful experience.

2. Sushi. Do I really need to explain this one? Truly ambrosiac.

3. Sun cream, because it's saved me a lot of pain recently.
