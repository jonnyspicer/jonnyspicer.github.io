<span >So I discovered Xiu Xiu today...&nbsp; avante garde, experimental art rock - check. Two smoking hot Asian girls - check. Album named after a super weird Japanese porno film - check. Actually interested in music as an art form - check. Insanely good musicianship, writing, vision as artists - check. Sign me the fuck up.</span>
