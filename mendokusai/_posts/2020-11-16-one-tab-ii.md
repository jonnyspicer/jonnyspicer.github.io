After a week of limiting myself to only have one browser tab open at a time, I would heartily recommend it to anyone who has trouble concentrating while using a computer. Forcing
myself to focus on one thing at a time has meant that I've found it a lot easier to both relax and be productive, now I no longer have the temptation of Twitter being open on another
tab or having to try to find the right Stack Overflow thread out of the 20 that are open. When I am working again, it will be interesting to say whether it's possible to stick with it
or if it'll become too tedious. I am also awful for having 20 Visual Studio/VS Code tabs open at a time, so perhaps those need a little discipline as well...
