title: Strangers' Validation II&#58; Niche Memes
tags: [ Misc ]
---
I had another dose of validation from strangers today, although in some ways I liked this one less. I read a tweet that was essentially a portmanteau reference to two other slightly-viral-but-still-fairly-niche memes. Understanding the tweet made me feel like part of some kind of exclusive club, like I had found some small corner of belonging on the
internet, to a tribe of people who don't spend enough time outside. There's even a [segment on a podcast I listen to](https://gimletmedia.com/tags/8gu9/yes-yes-no){:target="_blank"}
dedicated to basically this, and explaining the tweets.

Incidentally, [this is the tweet](https://twitter.com/MilesKlee/status/1315782205629583360){:target="_blank"} and [this one](https://twitter.com/JackWilliamRtF/status/1315756888806617088) and [this one](https://twitter.com/redditships/status/1315293084318683138){:target="_blank"} are the context you need. Welcome to the club.
