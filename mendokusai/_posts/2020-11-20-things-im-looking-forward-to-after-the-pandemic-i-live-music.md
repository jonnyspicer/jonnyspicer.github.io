title: Things I'm Looking Forward To After The Pandemic I&#58; Live Music

Just like everyone else, there are a lot of things I'm looking forward to once some semblance of normality returns to the world. I've not wanted to get my hopes up previously, given
I had no idea when said normality might arrive, but with all the promising vaccine news recently, I think I'm going to allow myself to start getting excited about things.

I had a lot of live music plans for 2020, so much so I even made a Spotify playlist back in February with all the artists I had booked or planned to see by the end of the year.
Fortunately I did actually get to see one band on the list, Polyphia, back in January along with Unprocessed and Tides of Man. My teenage fantasy of seeing My Chemical Romance play
live was set to become a reality back in May, but now it'll have to wait at least another six months.

Listening to King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard's Live in San Franciso '16, released today, has made me desperate to see them live once I have the opportunity to do so. When gigs are
safe to go to again, I'll be there, and I can't wait.
