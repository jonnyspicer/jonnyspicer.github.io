<span >Even talking about being a role model feels a little arrogant to me. I do not think anyone should look up to me at all, but sometimes it seems like I don't really have a choice in the matter. I would rather nobody looked up to me, but you can't exactly turn round and tell somebody not to. So, I guess the only thing left is to try really hard at whatever I do, and hopefully encourage people around me to do the same.&nbsp;</span>
