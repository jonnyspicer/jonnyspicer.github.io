Every day, ish, I write in my journal in the morning, and there is a heading called *Intentions*. Every day, ish, I write some variation of "be present" as my sole intention. I think
if I was better at simply, noticing what was right in front of my nose, I would be a lot happier - as I'm sure I've written here before - but I still spend the majority of my day
lost inside my own head, anywhere but here. So it looks like I will keep writing the same intention down every day, ish.
