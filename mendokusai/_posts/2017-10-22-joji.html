<span >Joji finally announced his first full EP for November 4th and I haven't been this excited about new music in a long time. Before I listened to him, I'd not heard anything similar and certainly not enjoyed it as much. I think his music articulates something I feel but struggle to express myself.&nbsp;</span>
