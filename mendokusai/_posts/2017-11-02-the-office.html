<span >The office is getting fuller now than when I first came to Playa, I suppose because November is the start of high season. There is a definite divide between those who work long, hard hours with little to no breaks, and those who spend long, hard hours doing absolutely nothing, whose whole life seems to be a coffee break. The ones working hard mostly seem to be software engineers, quietly grinding out what must be hundreds of lines of code a day, and there's fan favourites, "the support guy", and "Dave from Plato" who makes sales calls in between his main profession which appears to be smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. I suppose I would like to include myself in the work-hard category, although I am likely just lying to myself.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Then there is the literally-never-ever-do-any-work group, whose common thread seems to either be that they are all "digital nomads". They are obnoxiously loud, spending larger parts of the day mentally jerking each other of, and bafflingly never seem to do any actual work to fund their supposedly-desirable nomad lifestyle. I thought I used to check Facebook too much but these guys have made me realise I was likely under-utilising the platform, it really is possible to occupy yourself for a solid 9-5 day simply by scrolling through the feed.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I'm not being entirely serious about what I think of them. I'm sure they do <i>something</i>, although admittedly I am not entirely sure what. Really I am just jealous, if they are happy then more power to them. But I always feel compelled to spend long hours in the office, take no days off, and try and eke out as much money as I possibly can, however they don't. I wonder if they know something I don't, and if so, what is it?</span>
