Today I ran my first [Park Run](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) something which even 6 weeks ago I didn't think I'd be remotely close to being able to achieve.
I managed a time of 30:34 when I was expecting to be nearer the 34-35m mark, so that was a pleasant surprise, especially given I had intentionally not set
myself a goal other than to complete the run without getting injured. Well - my goal was to do it in less than double the time of my housemate Sam, who
finished only 1.5 minutes after I began my second lap, winning the race in a cool 17:50. Getting to run with that many people, on a gorgeous day, around
a beautiful course, was an amazing experience, and one I am excited to repeat next week.

So far I am enjoying the whole running experience a lot, in part because the weather has been amazing and the routes around me are stunning, and in part
because I started off better than I'd thought and I'm progressing fast in a short space of time. I am already getting ahead of myself a little in terms
of plans and goals, so I have been making an effort to reel it back and just take it one run at a time. Hopefully I can maintain at least some of this
enthusiasm once my initial infatuation fades.
