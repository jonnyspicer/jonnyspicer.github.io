I am very fortunate in that I don't (yet) get especially bad physical hangovers, even after a very heavy night of drinking, but I do get emotional ones. Whenever I've had a few drinks,
the next day I find myself feeling down and anxious about nothing in particular, feelings which usually disappear once my head becomes clear again the day after. Given the already
precarious nature of my mental health without this additional self-inflicted emotional volatility, drinking is becoming less and less appealing to me. Obviously it's still a big part
of my environment, and there are friends I have whom I can't imagine doing anything with other than having a beer, but I guess I'm gonna have to deal with those things. Next month I
want to commit to Dry January and not drinking a drop after New Year's Eve, and I am sure I will obnoxiously blog about how great teetotalism is, and by extension how great I am, in
future posts. I might even offer a freeroll for it...
