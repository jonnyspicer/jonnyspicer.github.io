I have a note on my iPhone titled "reasons not to kill yourself". The third bullet is "so you can watch Shingeki no Kyojin Season 4" (which will be the final season), and today, the
first episode of the season was made available on streaming services. It was apparently so popular that at the time of release, both Crunchyroll and Funimation (the two biggest anime
streaming platforms) went down, so I had to wait an extra 15 minutes to be able to watch it, but having already waited months, an extra quarter of an hour wasn't too painful. It was,
unsurprisingly, amazing, just like every other episode of SnK has been, gritty, emotional, raw, compelling. I was gutted when the end credits played because I didn't want to wait
another week to find out what happens next.

I'm very glad I am alive to see it though.
