<p>
  So, at this point, the bonsai tree I bought is pretty dead, which speaks volumes
  about me. I am kinda sad that I couldn't nurture it, but the stakes were still
  fairly low - after all, it was only a $20 tree after all, not a child or something.
  In these situations, people have been advising me for years to try to draw
  some kind of positive from the experience, to reflect on what I have learned
  so that I do not kill any more tiny trees in the future. So, here are some of
  the things I learned during the miniature murder which I committed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Do your research before you buy.</strong> Don't let your ego get ahead
    of you, and assume you'll be able to figure it out, or just wing something
    that you've never done before. Do some research on what's involved with
    bonsai care, the best type of tree to buy, what your tree will need from you etc.
    And then go buy a tree, after you've done all that, you idiot.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1h1eCU7.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
    Always fully commit.</a></strong> Once you've realised your own lack of
    knowledge and admitted to yourself that actually, this is going to be a significant
    amount of work, own it. Don't pussyfoot around, now you have made a mistake,
    embrace it and throw yourself into putting it right.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bonsais are needy motherfuckers.</strong> Seriously - I didn't water it
    enough and it started dying, and then I watered it too much and it continued
    dying. Make up your goddamn mind.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I have had to awkwardly hide the remains of the tree in my room before people
  visit the flat this evening as I am too ashamed of my own failure in my duty
  of care over the plant. RIP.
