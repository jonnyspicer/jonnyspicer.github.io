I've lived my whole life having varying degrees of shame about being a man (especially given that I belong to a handful of other demographics that put me in the most privileged among
society), often with a lot of guilt that I don't have more gratitude for the exceptionally fortunate position I am in, that I am not making enough of it. That I am not doing
enough with it, not engaging with issues surrounding privilege out of some combination of anxiety, cowardice and apathy. I have always told myself that I am not a stereotypical,
"manly" man, as a way of absolving myself of some amount of responsibility. Recently, in a mixed group at the pub, one of the men asked women who they thought the most masculine
in our number was, and I was genuinely offended when they suggested it was *me*. I don't really follow team sports (certainly not avidly enough to avidly defend my club-of-choice's
honour to a total stranger while 6 pints deep every Saturday afternoon), I try really hard not to be outwardly aggressive, I try not to be overtly chauvinistic. And I told myself
for a long time that that was good enough.

But obviously it's not. It's not good enough for the people around me and it's not good enough for *myself* either. Despair is not helpful. To not take responsibility would
be the true thing to be ashamed of here.

I am really, really scared to write about this kind of thing. In many ways, I think it's easier for me to write about mental health or suicide than this. I'm scared that I'll
say the wrong thing, that I am starting this journey far, far later than I should have and that I'll inadvertently out myself as being a self-absorbed narcissist, or far
less tolerant than I might like to tell myself I am, or in some other way reveal something about myself which will force me to confront the fact that I am a fundamentally
worse person than I had believed. When I search for what kind of man I want to be, one of the few constants is an honest one. So even if I am scared of getting something
wrong, I have to keep trying to express myself openly, because that's the only way I'll correct it.

I've been doing a fair bit of this aforementioned searching this week, and I regret not starting a lot sooner, because I think finding the answers is going to take a lot longer
than I'd anticipated. Trying to find role models for masculinity is alarmingly difficult - both public figures and those to me embody qualities that I think are worth embracing
as pillars of manhood, but none provide the full picture (sorry Ted). Even more alarming is to do the opposite, and try and think of counter-examples; virtually everyone man
I can think of possesses some trait that I find less than admirable.

The takeaway though as, as mentioned above, firstly that despair is not useful, and second that some men have some qualities that I would like to pick 'n' mix into my own
polystyrene cup of personality. It's going to be a lot of conscious effort to find these men, these qualities, and then figure out how to apply them to myself to the point
where I live and breathe them, and am the man I want to be. A good man.

But the work is my responsibility, and so it must be done.
