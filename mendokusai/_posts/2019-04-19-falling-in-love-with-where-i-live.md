Upon my return to Guernsey, I was struck by an awful realisation - I actually
don't really hate it here anymore. This is a problem because I get off to loudly
talking about how much I hate things, in particular living here, and I worry if
that changes then part of my identity will be lost.

Perhaps this is one blow to my ego that I will have to grin and bear though,
as I will now freely admit that Guernsey is a great place to live in many
respects. It's incredibly safe, surrounded by natural beauty, I can walk everywhere
I need to, and my friends and family are by and large on my doorstep. Sure,
I have some pretty major unanswered questions about our political system,
economic drivers and collective social consciousness, and those are all things
worth being concerned about - but perhaps they do not have to outweigh the positives.

It seems the next step may be to try and take action towards improving the things
I don't like, rather than simply whining the whole time.
