Once upon a time violent video games got a bad rap, and I think by and large people are pretty over it, but I actually think they can (potentially) be a powerful *positive*
tool for catharsis and emotional regulation. My evidence is purely anecdotal of course, but after a long, stressful, angry day today, I sat down this evening to murder hordes
of zombies in Killing Floor 2, its tech-death soundtrack blaring through my headphones. Having played through a few levels, my body count now in the thousands, I already feel a
lot calmer, and have processed some of rage and frustation
today has inflicted upon me.
