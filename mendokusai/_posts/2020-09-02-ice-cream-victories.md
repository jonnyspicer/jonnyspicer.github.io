Ever since I've bought my own food, ice cream has been my go-to binging staple. I can't remember a time in my adult life when I have bought a tub of Ben & Jerry's and not consumed it
in a single sitting. During a particularly bad week, that could even be a daily occurence, one which would leave me feeling awful afterwards but equally one which I felt wholly
powerless to stop.

For the past few weeks, Ben & Jerry's has been on offer at the supermarket - 2 for Â£6. I have inherited my mother's love of special offers and naturally stocked up, and something
miraculous has happened. I have eaten each tub in two sittings. I have not smashed the whole thing in 10 minutes flat, felt physically nauseous and mired myself in shame, no, I have
eaten slowly, savoured it, and stopped once I felt full or felt like continuing would only diminish my enjoyment of this delicious ambrosia.

It might not seem like a big deal, but I think it is, and I think it's important to celebrate victories that aren't pegged to weight or waist size. Maybe next week I'll really push
the boat out and try and stretch a tub to three whole desserts.
