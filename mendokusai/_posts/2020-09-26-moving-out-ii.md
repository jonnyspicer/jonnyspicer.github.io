Moving most of my stuff out of the flat today was pretty sad to be honest. While I did spend much of the time living there under the grey blanket of depressive episodes, I have a lot of
fond memories regardless, and it really felt like home. I think I'm going to miss it.

With that being said, wherever I end up living next (and whenever that happens to be) I think it's going to be a big step up. I want it to be clean and full of plants (not just one
solitary desk cactus), somewhere with personality and vibrance rather than a generic young male minimalist living space. Hopefully that new, enticing living situation materializes
sooner rather than later.
