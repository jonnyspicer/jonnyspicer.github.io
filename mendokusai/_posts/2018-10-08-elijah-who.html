  Today has been a really rough day, but I whine enough in this blog,
  so I wanna talk about something positive instead. After listening to
  some lofi hip-hop while trying to work, I remembered <a href="https://elijahwho.bandcamp.com/"
  target="blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow">elijah who.</a>

  His(?) music is super relaxing, and made it easier to get through the
  day relatively meltdown-free. Cheers, elijah.
