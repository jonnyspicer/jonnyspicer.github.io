After a very preachy post about intermittent fasting the other day, it only feels right to balance things out with an appreciation post for Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I have been
told that you can eat it in increments of less than one tub, but I can't see the appeal in that at all. It's incredibly delicious. It feels an emotional void that literally nothing
else will. And if I don't log it in my calorie tracker, I can just kinda pretend it never happened. It really is perfect.
