I always used to feel a lot of guilt when I spent a lot of time bingeing a show on Netflix or sunk hours into a new video game. Having watched three whole seasons of Killing Eve
in less than a week when there was plenty of 'productive' things I wanted to get done, it is something I am doing my best to stave off again now.

One piece of advice I heard that has helped me the most is not to fight the urge to binge, and instead to free up as time as possible for it, to get it all out of your system,
and then move on. I think it works quite likely, assuming shows like Killing Eve or games like Disco Elysium only come around a handful of times a year. Hopefully nothing else
incredible comes around for a couple of months and I can get some work done.
