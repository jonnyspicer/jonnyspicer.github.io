title: Can Jonny Actually Read Challenge 2.0

In 2018 I read no books whatsoever, and so last year I set myself the lofty goal of reading 52 in 52 weeks. Obviously, I failed, managing a measly 6, but at least that was
an infinite improvement. This year I have decided to set a goal that is a little more achievable - to read a single book. The only problem is that that book is David Foster
Wallace's legendary epic, *Infinite Jest*. At 1079 pages long, it may well compromise more than the sum of the 6 books that I read last year, and will most likely make for a
much denser read. Still, that is the point of settings oneself a challenge right?

Look forward to my review sometime around December...
