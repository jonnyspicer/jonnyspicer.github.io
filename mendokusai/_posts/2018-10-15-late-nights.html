  Sleep is undoubtedly one of the most +EV things in life, and one which
  we all seem to wilfully disregard far too often. Tonight, I stayed up
  "past my bedtime" as it were, but did I achieve something meaningful
  because of it? I hope so...

  On one hand, I finally managed to boot Ubuntu on my old laptop, after
  thinking I'd bricked the entire thing multiple times during the process.
  It's slow, but it's light and portable, and will make a nice machine
  to code on-the-go without shelling out a grand for a Macbook.

  On another hand, I had a bizarre conversation with a girl... I have
  no idea if I really learned anything or if this was +EV. Relating
  to people and not PCs is definitely something I need to practise though,
  so I'll call this one a win.

  Despite going to bed late, I still plan on getting up early tomorrow
  to try to smash through some more CS50. g0g0g0g0 me
