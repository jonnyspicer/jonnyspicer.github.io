Today is a day during which I forced myself to do nothing - or at least nothing productive. Nothing which I felt I "should" do, with the exception of leaving the house for a bit to go
for a walk, which is one of the healthier possible self-imposed obligations in my eyes. It was a lot more difficult than I'd hoped it was going to be, but I think that difficulty is
what makes it any exercise doing.

There is really very little that I "should" do - past taking care of my physical and mental health, even less so. I have a lot of time on my hands - time I want to use to make myself
happy first and foremost. Everything else can be secondary for a little while.
