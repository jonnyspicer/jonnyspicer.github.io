We are living in a bizarro timeline where satire and authenticity are homogenous and indistinguishable, such that the former is wholly effortless, and I worry that satire-as-an
-artform is soon to be lost to the sands of time. I recently watched [We Like Sportz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEVdca9U9LM){:target="_blank"}, a mere 11 years old, and
it already feels a little forced and somewhat out of place amongst today's ultra-meta satirical landscape (although I still think it's hilarious).

Perhaps the barrier for legitimately excellent satire is simply much higher, now it is easier to come by in mediocrity... Maybe if I ever get round to writing my novel, it'll
be a caricaturish magnum opus. Did I mention I'm reading Infinite Jest?
