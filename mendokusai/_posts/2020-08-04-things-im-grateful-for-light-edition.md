title: Things I'm Grateful For&#58; Light Edition

I'm grateful for the light in my life - in a very literal way. I am grateful that my light alarm gently nudges me awake with its calming aura - it's always a far better start to my
day than the violent jolt of my phone alarm. I'm grateful for my lightbox, for cramming as many endorphins into my brain as possible during the dark winter mornings. I'm grateful to
the sun, for encouraging me to synthesize vitamin D, helping me to be healthier - and I'm glad I see more of it now than I used to.
