I've still been trying the whole, choose-what-you-think thing. By and large it's going OK, but I've been wondering
if it marks a distinction between being mentally healthy and not. Now I am by and large feeling fine, it's quite
easy to move my attention to something else if and when my thoughts wander to something I deem to be unhelpful.
When I get really down again though, I know that will be impossible - and not impossible in the sense of "really
difficult and I'm a bit scared and maybe lazy so I'm just going to say it's impossible", impossible in the sense
of genuinely 0% chance of success.

Maybe I am wrong though - perhaps a lot practice at it while it is easier might mean that impossible could be
bumped up to simply very difficult in the future.
