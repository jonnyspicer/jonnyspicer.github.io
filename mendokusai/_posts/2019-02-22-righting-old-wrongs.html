  Today I apologised for something I did a long time ago, that I have felt guilty
  about ever since. It shouldn't have taken me as long as it did, but it is
  a weight off my mind. Slowly working my way through everybody in <a href="/tartarus/2018/10/26/an-open-letter-to-all-my-friends-ever" target="_blank">
  this post</a> feels amazing - I find it all to easy to forget how many amazing
  friends I have and have had, and how rewarding (re)forging meaningful connections
  can be.
