In my ongoing quest to be one of these outdoors-y people who says yes to things, I went ice-skating for the first time in probably a decade today. I don't think I've concentrated so
hard on something for 45 minutes in months. I listened to a podcast about Tonya Harding earlier this week, and let's just say I wasn't exactly pulling off any triple lutzes.
I would describe the experience as predominately *stressful* with arms flailing, feet everywhere apart from underneath me, and my face
permanently etched with a particularly focused terror; in other words, full Bambi. On the bright side, at least I improved a lot throughout the session (really the only way to go
was up), and I managed to avoid injuring myself, which was really my primary objective.

I might even try it again next week.
