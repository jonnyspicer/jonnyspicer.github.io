  I am determined to stop drinking and switch to some kind of plant-based diet.
  I want this post to hold me accountable. From January 1st I am taking a long
  (minimum 3 months) break from drinking, and when I move out of my parents' place
  I am moving to a plant based diet - minimum no red meat. Wish me luck g0g0g0g0 me.
