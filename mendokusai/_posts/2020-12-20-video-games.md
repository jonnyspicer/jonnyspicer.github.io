I've always played a lot of video games. They're the best tools for escapism I've ever found, and I've spent most of my life wanting to escape from things. Having just finished
Cyberpunk 2077 in less than 10 days, I've realised that that sense of escapism is pretty addictive, and I think I'm hooked. When there is something I want to play, it's all that I
think about, it dominates my free time and to be honest, I feel totally out of control of it. There's been a lot of things I've wanted to get done in the last ten days, that I need
to get done at some point, that I would've felt good about doing, that I simply haven't. Video games are fine in moderation, but moderation has never been my strong suit. There are
other ways to relax, to escape if I need to, and I think in 2021, the games might be staying in their boxes.
