This morning it seems like Flybe are poised to immediately cease being
an airline, and with it, thousands of promises to fly someone from A to
B will vanish into the ether.

I am planning a lot of flights in the near future, but for once, my
laziness has been a boon - I haven't got round to booking any of them
yet, unlike some of my friends, who have awoken this morning to find
that they're going to need to further dent their bank balance. Hehehe.
