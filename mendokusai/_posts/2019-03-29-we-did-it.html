  I'm acutely aware of the fact that whenever I get my hopes up about something,
  the potential for disappointment increases exponentially. I even try deliberately
  not to try to become too hopeful about anything, for fear of not being able
  to handle the potential pain of said hopes not becoming a reality.

  For the past week, I had my hopes up about something, and have been embroiled
  in a battle to bring them back down to earth, to convince myself that I would
  fail, to soften the blow of the inevitable rejection that I would eventually face.
  However, as it turns out, the outcome I wanted actually came to fruition. It
  is somewhat bittersweet, in that I feel as if I would have been far more
  upset than I should've been if things hadn't worked out this way. Regardless,
  for now I am just going to try to allow myself to enjoy this moment as fully
  as I would've allowed myself to wallow in the pain of defeat.
