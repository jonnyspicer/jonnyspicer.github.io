  While deep down a Hacker News rabbit hole this week, I discovered <a href="https://medium.com/message/just-checking-in-d2b5540f0064" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  this Medium post</a> (sorry to send you to everyone's least favourite blogging platform,
  but it can't be helped). It went some way to reinforcing my e'er-precarious faith
  in humanity, and I would go so far as to say it is one of my favourite things
  that I've read on the internet.

  The fact that two people can have such an intelligent and hilarious conversation
  that shows such a deep understanding of each other, <i>without ever having
  met in person</i> is a testament that technology can still be a positive force
  in all our lives. It's also a poignant reminder of our ability as people to
  feel empathy for another and express that in a beautiful way.
