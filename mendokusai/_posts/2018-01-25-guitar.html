<span >Learning a new skill entirely from scratch is great because you get the delicious feeling of improvement with minimal effort. I am trying to learn to play the guitar and even though I have not practiced much at all, I am already close to being able to play 3 or 4 songs I really like. Hopefully soon I will be able to serenade potential future wives.&nbsp;</span>
