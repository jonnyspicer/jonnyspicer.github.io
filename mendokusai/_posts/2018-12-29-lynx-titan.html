  I am 100% sure I've written about Lynx Titan before, but I can't find where...
  anyway, he finally did it. The Swedish madman has achieved 200m experience in
  every skill on Oldschool Runescape, becoming the first player to do so. It's
  taken him at least 20000 hours over the last 4 years, maybe closer to 25000.

  I am still undecided as to whether this is a legendary achievement that should
  be marked in the annals of gaming history, or if this is a colossal waste of time
  and the kid should like, get a job or a girlfriend or something.
