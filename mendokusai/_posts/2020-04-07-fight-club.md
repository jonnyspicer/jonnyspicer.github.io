Back in the day, I used to quite like UFC, and a few years ago I'd even stay up to ungodly Greenwich Meridian hours in
order to watch the big fights. Today, I am much less keen on it though, given Dana White ludicrously announced that he
is in the process of [acquiring the use of a private island](https://www.tmz.com/2020/04/06/dana-white-ufc-249-private-island-fights-joe-rogan/){:target="_blank"}
in order to host weekly events there.... what the actual fuck. There is a literal global crisis, and rich people are
paying people to fly to some jurisdictionless spit of land so they can beat the shit out of each other for the
entertainment of the masses? What kind of dystopian nightmare is this?
