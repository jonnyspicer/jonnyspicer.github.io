I've been a huge fan of English post-punks Black Country, New Road since hearing their first single, *Athen's, France* in 2019, and have been desperate for them to release an album
ever since. Today was finally the day, with their release of *For the first time* and I'm so happy that it's lived up to my expectations. They have a very "music school rock band"
kinda sound, reminiscent of an edgier version of Bent Knee, and I think they make it work triumphantly. They have a raw and complex sound, but not one that verges onto chaos in the
same way compatriot and touring partners black midi often do. The violin and saxophone add a great depth to the sound and seem to draw from both avant-garde jazz and Romani music,
when combined with Isaac Wood's anxious, pained vocals make for an intense ride. *Sunglasses* was possibly my favourite single of last year, and I love that they've reworked it for
the album version, for the second time. For a debut album it's remarkably coherent and all six tracks blend seamlessly into one another, as if each is a movement in a larger piece of
music. I've already listened to it several times through today.

I'm sure their music and their listeners could deservedly be criticised for being pretentious, but who cares, I think it's amazing. Already an early contender for album of the year,
9/10.
