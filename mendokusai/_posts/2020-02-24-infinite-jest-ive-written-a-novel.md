title: Infinite Jest&#58; I've Written a Novel

Last year, Josh and I had a conversation about how we'd never write a novel, because we'd want it to
be our own Infinite Jest, and neither of us are any David Foster Wallace. It seemed like a thankless
creative endeavour as we would both set wholly unrealistic and unattainably high bars for ourselves,
and so we would simply never even try.

Having said that, according to my [calculations](https://github.com/jonnyspicer/jonnyspicer.github.io/blob/master/wordcount.py){:target="_blank"}, I've actually written enough words in the last 3 and a bit years to
constitute a fairly beefy novel: approximately 150862 (in reality it is probably higher as that
script only splits words by spaces, and I quite like doing that-thing-where-you-hyphenate-all-the-words). According to [this completely arbitrary source](https://self-publishingschool.com/how-many-words-in-a-novel/){:target="_blank"}, that's more words than any
category of non-technical book they list. Admittedly, it's still not quite Infinite Jest, which,
according to Ryan Compton, weighs in at a hefty [577,608 words.](http://ryancompton.net/2014/06/06/statistical-features-of-infinite-jest/){:target="_blank"} Clearly a lot of my words are (exceptionally) low quality,
but still, I clearly have it in me to write the kind of volume required for a novel, and in a
reasonable amount of time, as I am demonstrably not a full time writer, nor do I consider blogging
a hobby, it usually only occupies ten minutes of my day. So, perhaps, one day...
