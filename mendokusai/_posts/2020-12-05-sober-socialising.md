As I think is probably very common for young British men, I will only ever invite my male friends for one kind of social engagement; a drink. And obviously the use of the indefinite
article is misleading there, because it's rarely if ever a single drink. Especially now that I'm *old*, I am falling out of love with drinking more and more, mostly because it has
a tendency to make me feel a bit shit the next day not physically, but emotionally - given my natural predisposition to feeling blue anyway, doing anything that might catalyse it
seems pretty dumb to me. I have no idea what to do with my friends other than drink, which also sounds pretty dumb on the face of it, but when things have been a certain way for
long enough, doing anything to upset the status quo of our relationship seems scary.

Sober socialising suggestions welcomed.
