As part of my contribution to the now-universal quest to avoid lockdown boredom by absorbing the entire Netflix catalogue, I recently finished watching *Maniac*, a Netflix original
limited series. My decision to watch it was made entirely based on the fact that it described itself as "dystopian" and "mind-bending" and starred both Jonah Hill and Emma Stone.
It transpired that my intuition for what particular mind-numbing media cocktail to try and self medicate with next was on the money, and I enjoyed the show a lot.

Both Hill and Stone are great, playing a handful of somewhat bizarre and off-beat roles throughout the course of the show. It touches on elements of mental health and our ever-more-fragile
notions about what does and does not constitute reality. The tone is fairly unique to anything I have ever seen, with a gentle sense of self-awareness permeating every episode, occasionally
being punctuated by moments of extreme camp or characters who are beyond caricaturish. Some scenes could've been lifted from *Garth Marenghi's Darkplace*, although obviously the whole thing
has a thick veneer of American sensibility which sadly stops it from transcending to Darkplace levels of brilliance. Maniac offers a plausible version of a dystopian near-future, albeit not
one with an especially great amount of depth, and the angle at which my mind was bent remained firmly acute at all times, but it was a fun ride nonetheless, poignant occasionally, well-written
and a very welcome escape into another world that was much needed during quarantine.
