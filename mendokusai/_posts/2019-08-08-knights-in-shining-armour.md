This is my second attempt at writing a blog post today. The first was quite feminist-y and seeing as I [wouldn't call myself one](/mendokusai/2019/05/07/should-i-call-myself-a-feminist-ii), about halfway through I wondered to myself if I am just
virtue signalling, trying to be a knight in shining armour, the perennial ally, the guy who
isn't like all the others.

Perhaps it is solely down to intention - my motivations for the now-axed post may have been
impure, and had I really written from a place of genuine desire for the betterment of women's
treatment in society, maybe I wouldn't have felt a little nauseous come the final paragraph.

At least part of me genuinely *does* want gender equality in our society. Many of my closest
friends are women, and some of my greatest inspirations come from said women around me. I also
feel like we don't really have the collective energy to spend on fixing these kinds of social issues, and that we face much more pressing problems as a society that we need to be united in
dealing with *now*. So maybe I'm not a knight in shining armour. Just a squire. Or perhaps a noble steed.

With that being said, what is the correct course of action? Maybe it is to do smaller, quieter
things. To be mindful of the way I talk to and about women, to re-examine my own beliefs and
biases, to try to do things better myself in the day to day, and see if others follow. That
seems slow though, maybe bigger, bolder action is necessary, and seeing as I am by and large a
~~little bitch~~ coward, writing this blog is about as big and bold as I get. But it feels diffifcult to do that in the right way, so it's difficult, so I feel uncomfortable and unsure doing it...

Then again, maybe I should stop whining as per, and remember that once again, I am not the victim.
