As I've just been summoned to taxi duty, it looks like another one of these is in order as I need to leave imminently.

1) The cliff paths of Guernsey, for being stunningly beautiful from start to finish, as well as a decent workout on the way.
2) The band Say Anything, mostly for their album ...Is A Real Boy, in my opinion one of the greatest feats of songwriting ever.
3) My car for retaining all four of its doors. If you know, then you know...
