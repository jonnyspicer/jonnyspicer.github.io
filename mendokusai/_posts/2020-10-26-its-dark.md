Now the clocks have gone back, it's dark when I walk home from work, and I absolutely hate it. Only seeing sunlight through a window for the whole day feels grim, I don't know how
people who live in the Arctic Circle do it. My light box is going to hopefully provide some assistance, although it's fairly violent in nature, and I'm going to start walking around
on my lunch breaks, at least when it's not pouring down.

I'm already counting down the days until the winter solstice.
