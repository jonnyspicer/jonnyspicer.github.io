There are some feelings I have that I don't want, and as far as I can tell only affect me negatively. Even with
this knowledge and a I desire to rid myself of them, I can't - apparently most emotions can't simply be willed
away. Which is kinda weird when you think about it - there is no catharsis in them, they might be highlighting
that I have a need that is not being met, but neither are they going to help me fill that need. It would be nice
if there was just some kind of on/off switch for them, but in its absence I guess talking to a therapist will
have to do.
