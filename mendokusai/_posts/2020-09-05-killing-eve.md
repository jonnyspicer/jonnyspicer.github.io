I have completely run out of time to write a blog today as I have been unexpectedly busy so all I have to say is that
I started watching Killing Eve this week, and it is mind-blowingly good. I love everything about it. If it continues
on its current trajectory then I think by the time I've finished watching it, it will be my favourite TV show ever.
