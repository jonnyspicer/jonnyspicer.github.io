A year since I wrote about [playing at being an adult](/mendokusai/2019/04/12/playing-at-being-an-adult){:target="_blank"}
and I still don't feel any more of an adult, and in many ways I feel even less sure of the path
I'm on. Being in quarantine has made adulthood seem an important, we must all do our civic duty,
make sensible and responsible decisions, nothing to do but try and stay healthy and work.

Reading the post again made me remember the feeling of staring at the Manhattan skyscrapers, feeling
like a dumbstruck child. It's a feeling I miss dearly, to just enjoy something so spectacular in
the moment without a care in the world, and it's a difficult one to find in these troubled times. Maybe
it's something I'll just have to look forward to in order to get me through, or perhaps there is
something I can do, while stuck inside all day, in order to get that sense of childlike wonderment
back again.
