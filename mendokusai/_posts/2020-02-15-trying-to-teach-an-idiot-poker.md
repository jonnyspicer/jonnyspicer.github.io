title: Trying to Teach an Idiot Poker

For starters, "idiot" was his choice of word and not mine, I think he is plainly very intelligent.
Really, attempting to teach Josh some of the basics of poker made me feel like the idiot, as I was
reminded how difficult it can be to distill internalised and subconscious knowledge into something
accessible and with as few prerequisites for understanding as possible.

It was a welcome reminder that the now-slightly-clichéd "if you can't explain it simply then you
don't understand it well enough" (which is something I think there is almost no way Einstein actually said and has been habitually misattributed) does have a good deal of truth to it. I still
need to work further on the very basics, the fundamental principles of the game, before I try
to lay any further masonry atop that foundation.

He is definitely better than all his friends thanks to my tuition now though.
