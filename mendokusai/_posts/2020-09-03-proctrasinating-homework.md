When I was in school, I would always procrastinate doing my homework - every single piece would get done the night
before at the earliest. Often I'd spend lunch breaks doing the work I was due to hand in in the afternoon. Now I am
older and by and large, I don't get homework anymore... that is, until I started seeing my current therapist, who gives
me homework every week.

I have therapy tomorrow at lunchtime. I am about to start doing my homework now. Some things never change :).
