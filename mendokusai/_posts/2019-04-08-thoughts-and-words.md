Unless you're [that weird Radical Honesty dude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM427B7qerE),
then there is a significant gap between the thoughts and feelings you experience
and the words you use to communicate them to the world around you. It seems
intuitive to me that in general, the smaller the gap, the happier the person.
Mine is definitely significantly larger than I would like it to be, and I feel
like I am constantly trying to make it smaller - but it is a steep mountain to
climb, and I am very scared to do so. I suppose I will have to channel my inner
