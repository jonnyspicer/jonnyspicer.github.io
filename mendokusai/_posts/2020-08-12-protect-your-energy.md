One of my favourite sections in Florence Given's book, *Women Don't Owe You Pretty* (review coming shortly), was the part where she describes the idea and importance of protecting
your own energy. Society demands our energy from us in many different ways, as do the people in our lives. I know that I personally tend to give it away very freely, in large part
because of my lack of self esteem. Relationships shouldn't be draining though, they should be nourishing, and I definitely have some where I feel like I give away a lot of my energy
for very little sustenance in return. Florence rightly points out its worth evaluating your relationships through this lens, and taking any steps necessary to protect your energy,
even if that means going as far aas cutting that person out.

Obviously that's tough, because part of me wants the validation that comes from friendships, even those which I don't find fulfilling, and is scared to hurt other people. But
ultimately, I have to learn how to put myself first, and Florence has given me a lot to think about.
