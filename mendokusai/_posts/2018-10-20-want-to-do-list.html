  Productivity "hacks" <strong>SUCK.</strong> It is not news, that
  you already know how to be productive. Remove distractions,
  carve out some time, and bite the bullet.

  This approach can be a little depressing though. And I struggle with it,
  I am always desperate for some way to trick myself into doing more
  work instead of playing another 6 hours of Pillars of Eternity. One
  thing that one of the members of GTO Club mentioned a long time ago
  was instead of having a "to do" list, they had a "want to do" list.
  It is not exactly a productivity hack, but it might help you reframe
  the items on the list just enough that it doesn't feel like a grind.

  Changing my long list of things to do this week into a long list of
  things I want to do this week was pretty neat, I'd recommend it.
