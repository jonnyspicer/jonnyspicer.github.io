Yesterday Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz's eponymous long-form 3-part improv comedy show came
to Netflix, and it is maybe the the funniest thing I've ever seen.

I've been a huge fan of both for over a decade when they used to appear in webisodes of Jake and Amir -
even then it felt a lot like they were doing their friends a huge favour - and my excitement to
get to see one of their legendary improv shoes on streaming services was immeasurable. Both are
acclaimed TV actors at this point, but their roots are still very much with them, and the bromance
is very strong indeed. Honestly, I cannot remember the last time I laughed like I have while watching,
this is my sincerest recommendation to also go watch it and enjoy for yourself.
