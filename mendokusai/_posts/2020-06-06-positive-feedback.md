I'm not very good at receiving positive feedback. Actually I'm terrible at it - it's a reflex for me at this point to
downplay whatever I might have done, ignore or dismiss the comment or even say that whoever is being kind to me clearly
lacks good judgment. This is obviously really dumb, because I am just training people around me to not say nice things
about me... and obviously I want people to say nice about me. I am only human after all, and who doesn't love sweet,
sweet validation. So, I would like to learn to accept positive feedback in a more gracious way, that will hopefully
in turn generate further such positive feedback. I just really wish it wasn't goinng to take as much conscious effort
as it inevitably will.
