After a brief hiatus from watching Adam Ondra videos, the YouTube algorithm has finally put me back in my place and reminded me that I
should be watching more [Adam Ondra videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRTNHDd0gL8). An insanely talented climber, watching him scream
as he sends crazy routes has provided a welcome boost of motivation on an otherwise uneventful Monday.
