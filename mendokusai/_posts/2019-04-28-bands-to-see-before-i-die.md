Having decided that I have nothing better to spend my money on than travelling to see gigs, I've finally got around to compiling a list of
bands I want to see before I die (or before they do). Hopefully I can start crossing some of these off next time they are in the UK, although with 
bands on the list from as far as Japan, perhaps I'll have to travel a little further afield to get to some of the shows I'm desperate to see.

- Alexisonfire, if they actually start touring again
- Vulfpeck
- King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard
- Black Midi
- Arcade Fire
- Tricot
- Elephant Gym
- Chon
- Pup
- Animals as Leaders
- Jeff Rosenstock
- Remo Drive
- Protest The Hero
- IDLES
- Beach Bunny
- Graduating Life
- Mitski
- Car Seat Headrest, again
- If they ever reform I'll drop my entire life to go see Modern Baseball live.
