Yesterday I mused for the millionth time upon what changes I was going to make to my diet in order to achieve the desired result, without falling pray to the notion that if I simply
repeat previous efforts, something will magically be different this time. Perhaps it seems a little foolish but I think it is important to keep trying, and furthermore to keep
trying different things, and eventually something will stick.

I am happy to report that I think I have a pretty good strategy this time, which is to take something that already works and apply it in a broader context - in this case
intermittent fasting. Having integrated the 16:8 into my lifestyle fairly comfortable over the past couple of years, I think making the switch to OMAD 5x/week is going to
be both a logical transition and one that is best placed to combat the emotional/addictive behaviours I have around food.

I'm writing this with about an hour to go until dinnertime on day 1, and so far it's felt like relatively smooth sailing - let's see how long that lasts.
