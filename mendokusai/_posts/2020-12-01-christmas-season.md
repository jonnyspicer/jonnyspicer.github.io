I promised myself I'd get all my Christmas shopping done before December, given that I had the time off work. I didn't want to leave it to the last minute and get stressed, like I
always too. Obviously, I haven't done any of it yet.

I'm not really a big Christmas person, for a number of reason. But ultimately I think actively disliking something that seems to bring so many people happiness is dumb, and so I'm not
going to write a post about how I really feel about Christmas. My therapist even said I should try to embrace it. So, having had my first advent chocolate of 2020, here I go, let's
see if I can manage to find myself some Christmas spirit by the time I eat the 25th.
