<span >... is so embarrassing. I don't like people finding out I have a blog and post my thoughts on the internet. It has happened to me a couple of times in the past couple of days, that people I know actually read what I write (and what else would I expect?) it makes me feel uncomfortable. I don't know if it is a reflection on blogging or a reflection on me, although I suspect it's the latter.</span>
