In the midst of some of the most aggressive protoss balance whine I've ever witnessed, four long years since a zerg player has been crowned the king of GSL - and
even longer since a now non-disgraced zerg was coronated - Dark finally did it. One of the most likeable top Korean players in the scene, not just because of his
demeanour and sense of humour but also because of his unique approach to matchups, has finally been rewarded for his tenacity and ingenuity by lifting the GSL trophy,
beating Trap 4-2 in the finals in some interesting games. Seeing Korean players, often emotionally restrained, reduced to tears with happiness is always a special moment,
and Dark certainly fit that bill - it really felt like winning this GSL might be the greatest achievement of his life so far.

Of course, there are still many questions left unanswered - gone are the days when winning GSL made you the best player in the world, and in fact, Dark still has some very
serious competition for the best zerg in the world, between himself, soO and Serral. Reynor and Rogue would also undoubtedly like a shot at the title too, and the race is
looking more tightly contested than it has in a while. With all of the final 4 of WCS EU Summer Challenger being zerg players too, what does this mean for the state of the meta?
Will nerfing protoss make zerg too strong? Terran buff when?
