This weekend is the Global Game Jam, and this year we have been infinitely more organised than last - we've got a full team of 6(!)
before the event has even started, and we've already decided on an engine and a version control system. It will be fun to try and
learn some Unity and make a game, but the thing I am most looking forward to is certainly the element of working in a team with
five of my friends. We even have a name - I Can't Believe It's Not Beta - and you can follow any progress we make on [Github.](https://github.com/ICantBelieveItsNotBeta)
