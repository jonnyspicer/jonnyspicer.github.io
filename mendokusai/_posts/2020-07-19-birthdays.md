I've always found birthdays a little underwhelming, although not because other people haven't tried to make them special for me. In some ways I love being the centre of
attention, but perhaps in the birthday sense I don't so much - or perhaps I just don't let myself. As always, (and it pains me to admit this) there is part of me that kind of
gets off on being a contrarian and not enjoying things that everyone else likes. Birthdays are a prime example of that.

But, that's obviously fucking stupid. So, I have just shy of four months to get over it and plan an actually fun birthday. So, what makes the ideal birthday?

Firstly, definitely not working. I am 100% taking the day off on November 8th. Anyone who works on their birthday really, really needs a cuddle and possibly to seriously re-evaluate
where their life is at. Food is definitely going to be a big part of it - it is obvious from simply looking at me that I love food. A big breakfast to start the day off right -
obviously you can't beat a full English - light lunch, maybe Thai - and then hefty dinner, either sushi or steak or both, and cheesecake for days. Heaven.

There would obviously be a large amount of drinking too; the goal is to start at lunch and be in a tipsy haze for the rest of the day. Things can pick up around dinner to try to offset
the sobering effects of that much food. Seeing as it's my birthday I also want one of those dodgy IV-for-rent things that they had in Mexico, so I don't have a hangover the next day
either.

Obivously the day would be spend with as many friends as I could muster. Despite it being November, it would be a gorgeously sunny, breezeless, 20 degree day anyway, and we'd duly
consume beers on the beach.

I don't really know what I'm getting at with this. I guess the point is to learn to actually enjoy letting things be about me on my birthday, and then let that extend to putting myself
first in other, less annual situations. We'll see how it goes in a few months time.
