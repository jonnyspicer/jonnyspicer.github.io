[Disco Elysium](/mendokusai/2020/03/03/disco-elysium){:target="_blank"} is one of my favourite games ever, and in fact might be one of my favourites pieces of art ever. A big part
of the reason I hold it in such high self esteem is because I thought the writing was truly phenomenal, a mixture of tragic, funny, insightful, witty, poignant and engaging at all
times - I cannot say enough good things about it.

It's so good in fact that someone set up a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/DiscoExcerpt){:target="_blank"} that simply tweets quotes from it, which I adore. Someone took things
a step further and trained the [GPT-2 language model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/){:target="_blank"} to produce further AI-generated "quotes", which duly
got their own Twitter bot - [endless disco.](https://twitter.com/Endless_Disco)

People talk a lot about the evils of technology, AI, etc etc, about Turing Tests and whether or not the creations of a robot could ever be considered art. But, I love the endless
disco, and I think it *is* art - which I think is amazing.

It also has me thinking, what if *I* could make artifically generated art...
