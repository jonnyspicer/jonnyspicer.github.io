The idea of "go to songs when you want to be happy" got brought up today, and I realised I don't have any - although I do have them for various other emotions. A lot of the way
I listen to music is by shuffling my 1000+ song favourites playlist and just skipping until I find a song that matches my mood, but in practice I think I rarely ever seek out
anything on there to make me happy. So that's my new goal for this week; make a playlist of songs to listen to when I need a boost.
