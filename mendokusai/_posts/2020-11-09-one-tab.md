I am horrible at tab management, as my former coworkers often could not help but point out. If I'm using virtual desktops, there's a good chance I have 50+ open. After all, if you're
going to have a machine with that much memory, why not use it right?

It is awful for my attention though - I can't find anything, I and am never focused on a single thing, always flitting back and forth between however many sites. After a while it
creates a kind of brain fog which then turns into a kind of malaise, all while seeming weirdly addictive.

My new plan to try to use my time more effective; only one tab. If I can only look at one at a time, then surely I only need to have one open at a time.
