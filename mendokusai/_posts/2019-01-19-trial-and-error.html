  Intuitively, one might feel that the biggest problem with generalised or social
  anxiety is that it prevents an individual from succeeding - however I would
  disagree. The most prevalent issue faced by anxiety sufferers, and
  indeed myself, is a lack of <i>failure.</i>

<p>
  Ok, I admit that my point here isn't exactly revolutionary, but sometimes it takes me a
  while to arrive at even an obvious conclusion, so humour me. Having struggled
  a lot with anxiety, particularly in the time since I left university, my coping
  strategy has been largely to avoid situations in which I might experience said
  anxiety. This is naturally only to a certain extent - I still leave the house
  every day, despite having anxiety about doing so. But, generally speaking, I
  cut out as many non-critical interactions that I have anxiety about - in terms
  of fight or flight, I have fled. Flew. Flown. I don't know.

  And now, I have suffered for it. I feel like my social skills are underdeveloped,
  my relationships aren't where I want them to be. In order to change those things,
  I will have to try, and failure is an inevitable part of trying. It's going to
  hurt - but I am hoping it won't hurt quite as bad as I think. I really need to

  feel the pain</a> - in fact my goal for the next couple of months is to feel as
  much of it as possible.
</p>
<p>
  To that end, tomorrow in particular there is quite a lot of potential for discomfort. Wish me luck.
