<p>
  A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about whether or not I still wanted this blog to
  be purely 'for me' or if I wanted to try to share more. Today, the answer is
  definitely, definitely that I still want it to be for me.

  Even considering trying to market the blog a little made me feel under a lot of
  pressure to write longer, higher quality posts every day, but the reality is that
  if I am tired and depressed (which is most days), then I just want to write a short
  post. And writing something short is <i>fine,</i> because it still serves the
  purpose I had when I started this blog, which was just to get in the habit of
  writing <i>something</i> every day. Even if that something is short because
  I'm having a rough time, I think that's better than nothing, or forcing myself
  to write something long.

  I feel like my posts this last week have been a bit short and maybe not quite
  as good as some were the week before that. I'm not gonna beat myself about it
  though, and I am about halfway through my 2018 year in review piece and it's
  looking like a long one, so you have that to look forward to.
