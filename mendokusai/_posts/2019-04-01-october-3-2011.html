  I want to write down my thoughts somewhere where I wont be able to loose them or
  throw them away.

  I moved in to my new place today. Living with some hippy lady and her crazy
  amount of animals. Who has a goose. I think it will go somewhere great and okay;
  time will tell.

  Lately I have been very motivated. But the problem every week it is another thing.
  One week it's fitness, the next it is school, then golf, now saving/earning money.
  Guess it's better than not being motivated at all.

  Recently I have been trying to help out my grandpa. We have always been really
  close. He is not all that happy with his life, in my opinion. And i'm trying
  to get him back on track. If anybody deserves to be happy, without a doubt, it
  is him. He is my pet project for the foreseeable future. Its going good so far
  but we got a ways to go. At least he is intelligent and open-minded, I would imagine
  change stands no chance verse most 78 year old men. Not him. I love him and
  love trying to help him.
