Today is the 18th of January, meaning the blog-a-day last longer bet is back, and I am very excited! I will get to read the thoughts of a good friend and practice articulating my own every single day. And
then at the end of it all, his money is going to buy me a very expensive steak, and what could be a more enticing prospect than that?

I will spend the next few days meditating on the lessons and prop bet wisdom I learned from Joey Ingram himself, before gleefully rubbing my hands together and riding off into the sunset, furiously typing out
post after post.

Please don't read them. They're all going to be awful.
