[A long time ago](/mendokusai/2017/10/27/the-recipe-for-success) I gave my three ingredients for success as
self-awareness, patience and work ethic. I would like to think that I have improved on all three fronts in
the two and a half years since writing that, but now I think there is fairly clearly some components of the
formula which I omitted; namely self-respect, knowledge of the market, networking & communication soft skills,
and of course, a huge amount of luck.

Admittedly the success I was desirous of at the time was that found in poker, so I'll forgive a little of my
naïveté, but now I am in software and so naturally the definition of success has changed (although I think
that all the other skills are equally as applicable to poker, they're just less obviously so). I think my
knowledge of the market is passable, and my luck seems to be boundless, however the others all have a long
way to go.
