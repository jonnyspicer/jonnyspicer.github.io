In the end, it took a little bit of peer pressure to get me out on the bike I know own - every time I thought about it, the anxiety of it got the better of me. It also turns out that
I had a totally flat back tyre and didn't realise at all, oops. With a pump in hand and several prods in the back to get me out the door, today was probably my most successful day
of cycling to date - there was a mixture of terrain, including gravel, dirt, tarmac, and my personal least favourite, sand - and my confidence grew quite a lot as the day went on.
At points it was even actually kinda... fun?
