<p>
  Today has gone by too fast... I had so much I wanted to do. And I haven't spent
  any time frivolously I don't think, no games, no Youtube videos, just productivity, the gym
  and socialising out with a friend, something that seems important for my health.
  But I am exhausted (again) and feel like I haven't made a dent in my to-do list
  for the weekend. If only there were more hours in the day... Time to try again
  tomorrow.
