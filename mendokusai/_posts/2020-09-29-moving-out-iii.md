Moving is incredibly exhausting, to me anyway. It seems to cover every single type
of exhaustion; physical from hauling a seemingly endless stream of boxes up and
down stairs, mental from having to work out how to do everything in the minimum
necessary number of car journeys and the Tetrisesque boot-packing that follows,
and emotional from reliving all the memories you made in your former home, while
coming to terms with the fact that you won't be making any more there.

I've not yet seriously considered settling down somewhere, but right now I can
most definitely see the appeal of moving once and then never again.
