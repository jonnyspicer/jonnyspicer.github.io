Even if I don't keep writing these here, I am definitely going to keep doing them in a journal. Everyone says to fake it 'til you make it with positivity, so hopefully I am doing a
good job.

1. My friends who will patiently teach me to cycle, even as an alleged full-grown adult.

2. Brad Leone, [for telling me how to make kimchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUwy71ddj1M){:target="blank"} in the way that only a golden retriever in a New Jerseyman's body
could.

3. Guinness. For being both nutritous *and* delicious.
