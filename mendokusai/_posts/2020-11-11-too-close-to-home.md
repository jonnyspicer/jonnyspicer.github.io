The whole point of entertainment is to make you feel things, but sometimes somethings make me feel a whole lot more than I wanted. I've always found myself getting emotionally invested
in characters and stories pretty quickly, and have been a habitual movie bawler my whole life, and I've always wondered why a little bit. I don't cry especially often in my day-to-day
life, probably less than is good for me, so why am I so susceptible to some films and TV shows?

Obviously I project heavily onto these characters. I think then in those projections, I really allow myself to feel things in a way that I don't when I'm still standing in my own
shoes, and sometimes that gets to be... a lot. When the movie ends, the feelings remain, as if viewing it has opened some kind of emotionally door within myself that can't be shut
again. It's a bad feeling, to rediscover parts of your mind that you'd done such a good job of shutting away that you'd forgot were there, and then be forced to confront them again.

Maybe it's a good thing to remember that part of me is there, or maybe it's not. Either way I'm going to be more careful with what I watch for the next couple of weeks.
