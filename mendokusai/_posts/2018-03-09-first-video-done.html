<span >First video recorded, edited, dubbed and mixed. Sort of, it's not like I did a very good job of any of those things, but hey. I'm reasonably happy with how it turned out, although I feel like I still have a million things I could do better, which seems like a fairly healthy approach to the project. It was interesting to have a vision of how I wanted it to be in my mind's eye, and how it actually turned out in the editor, and then how much time/effort I would invest to get it slightly closer to my original idea. In the end I actually got it fairly close, with the exception of the fact that my audio commentary is less than perfect, but that will come with practice I suppose. I would've had to rerecord it all tomorrow and redo the music/edit the voice audio different, so in the end I decided I would rather leave it imperfect but upload it overnight.</span><div><span ><br /></span></div><div><span >In other news I joined the OSRS clan Sigma today, on trial for a week. They are pretty much the top non-elite skilling clan, so it should be fun to have out with those guys in game from now on.</span></div>
