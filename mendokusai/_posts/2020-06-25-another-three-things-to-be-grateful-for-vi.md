Sorry, I'm busy today and there's nothing else I feel comfortable writing about, so you're stuck with another one of
these.

1. The nice weather. British people complain that it's too hot, and then when it's not they complain they haven't seen
the sun in years. I'm quite enjoying the sunshine, even if it means I need to be extra vigilant with anti-perspirant.

2. Being able to spend time alone. I've spent a lot of time in my life, and especially in my life since lockdown, feeling lonely,
but I'm slowly learning how to turn it into something productive. There's a lot of empowerment to be had in realising that
you can satisfy your own emotional needs, if you put the effort in. I feel especially grateful knowing that some of my
friends are ~~trapped~~ quarantining with their partners or others, and that my colleagues have families who demand large
amounts of their time and attention.

3. Friends with different experiences and points of view. I think a lot of us know to some extent that we have formed
an echo chamber around ourselves, and that is true for me to a large degree, at least it's not 100% true. I'm often
scared to talk about this differences, but actually I think it'd be good for all involved if I did it more.
