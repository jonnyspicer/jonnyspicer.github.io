Some days there is truly nothing I want to write and attach my name to and post to the internet. I just don't have anything that I think is valuable or interesting or funny or worth
anybody's time to read, and today is absolutely one of those days. I tried writing a couple of others posts besides this one and I hated them, I hated the process and felt so
disingenuous.

But I also really don't like losing money, and so you get to read this garbage instead and I will get to keep my hard earned Ethereum in my wallet until another day.
