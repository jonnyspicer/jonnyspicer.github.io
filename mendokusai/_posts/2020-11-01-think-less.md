If I could distill all my therapist's advice to me thus far into just two words, it'd be these: think less. So many of the issues I struggle with come from taking a thought and
getting stuck on it, allowing it to go round and round between my ears like an out-of-control washing machine. These thoughts do such a good job of taking up mental space, not only
do they exclude all other thoughts, they exclude sights, sounds, experiences - whatever is right in front of me, right now.

Sure, reflection and introspection can be useful in moderation, but past a point they aren't doing me any good at all, and are in fact making me feel a lot worse. Perhaps it's time to
start bingeing podcasts all day, so I can take comfort in hearing somebody else's thoughts and not my own.
