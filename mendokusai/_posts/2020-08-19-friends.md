In my own mind, I have a lot of good reasons to have low self-esteem (don't worry, I have no interest in listing them in this blog post). The biggest piece of evidence to the contrary
though is the people who choose to be friends with me. I am incredibly lucky to be friends with some of the most intelligent, wise, kind people I know - people who have a *lot* going
for them - and who willingly elect to spend some portion of their time and energy on me. This is in spite of all kinds of things that in my head I assume are a negative effect on
them over time - I assume that eventually they will get to some threshold of knowing the "real" me and they'll run for the hills. But they're all still here, and it's been years.
I still struggle to see in myself what they see in me - but if they see it, then I think it's probably there, somewhere.
