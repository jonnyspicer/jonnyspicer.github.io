  Today I enrolled in Harvard's CS50x, the online version of its Introduction
  to Computer Science module. From what I can tell, CS50 basically covers
  all the actual computer science necessary for being a software engineer,
  and as such it is well respected within the industry.

  I have heard the course is fairly hard, and knowing myself, I am
  somewhat worried that I will burn out, however I shelled out $90
  for a certificate at the end, so hopefully that will motivate me.

  I completed problem set 0 today, which involved making a programme in
  Scratch, coincidentally enough the same language we use to teach
  10 year olds at Code Club. It was pretty fun, and I made something
  with some basic logic in, but the amount of repeating myself I did
  was pretty gross - if anyone has any suggestions for refactoring,
  they'd be greatly appreciated! You can see the project
  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/252383243/">here.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Problem set 1 is based around C, somewhat at the other end of the
  spectrum to Scratch. Fortunately the basics at least vaguely resemble
  PHP, so I am not completely at sea (pun wholeheartedly intended), but
  I think it's going to ramp up pretty quickly. GL me.
