Imagine thinking that you'd be able to win a last longer bet about blogs when it takes you [six commits to even successfully publish one blog post...](https://github.com/sted9000/sted9000.github.io/compare/558dbf8b7a...5b23b63e58){:target="_blank"} [Or six months to correctly spell your own name.](https://github.com/sted9000/sted9000.github.io/commits/2271c53548d9dac93a50754c1af64c4a0aa56507/_includes){:target="_blank"}

My favourite thing about poker was always hurting other people's egos, the money was just a convenient corollary. Everyone knows
you can't just crush the fish or they'll never play the game again, every so often you've got to lose a pot just to keep them on the
hook...

Good luck buddy <3
