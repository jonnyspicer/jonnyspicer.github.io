I've [already talks about how dumb and arrogant unsolicited advice is](/mendokusai/2019/03/30/advice),
but today I am wondering exactly where the line should be. On one hand, if you
genuinely *knew* you could make someone happier, don't you have some kind of
obligation to do it? Especially if they are your friend, and it would be relatively
little effort on your part. Of course, you can never know 100% that whatever
you say or do will make another person feel better, so how confident do you
need to be?

I think in these scenarios it's exceptionally difficult to have a high confidence
interval - I'm reminded [of the Mormons](/mendokusai/2019/02/13/gods-children) who
I'm sure genuinely believe that they can make other people happier, and that
it is their duty. Conversely, I genuinely believe that they are delusional, and
while I guess it is possible that we are both right, it seems unlikely in the
majority of instances. Am I right to be put off offering any kind of unsolicited
advice out of a sense of altruism for fear of becoming like them? Sometimes I
want to help my close friends, but I obviously don't know what's best for them -
should I stay in my lane? Get better at communicating my feelings? It seems obvious
when put in those terms, but in reality I think the problem is far more nuanced
and difficult to make decisions about.
