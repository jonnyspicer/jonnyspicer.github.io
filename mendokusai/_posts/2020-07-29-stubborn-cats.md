Today, as I attempted to leave the garage in my car, a bold tabby cat blocked my path. I edged towards it, assuming
it would realise my superior mass and subsequent flattening power, but no, it remained steadfast and stared me down.
I revved a little, hoping to gently encourage it to vacate my planned exit, but it cared not. I considered honking,
but that seemed like an unnecessary escalation of the situation, and I did not want to be driven to honking by this
mere persistent feline.

In the end, I had to very careful circumnavigate said cat in order to leave the house. I felt thoroughly bested.
