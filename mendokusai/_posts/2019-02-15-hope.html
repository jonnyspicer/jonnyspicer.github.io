  Once again far, far too exhausted to write anything lengthy or thought out tonight.
  So, just an observation of the day - hope is severely underrated. I would say
  it is practically vital in order to have a fulfilling human experience. We are,
  by nature, never satisfied with the present, and if we don't have hope for a
  better future, the situations starts to become bleak very fast.

  Sure, I should just focus on getting better at appreciating what I already have,
  and being satisfied with the way things are. But that would go against years
  of conditioning myself to think otherwise - so I am going to settle for
  trying to incubate as much hope for positive future change as possible.
