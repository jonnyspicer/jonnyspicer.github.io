For the past 7 or so years I have picked up my trumpet circa once annually, and today was 2020's turn. I miss playing in jazz band a lot, the camaraderie of it, but now I'm a boring
adult with boring adult responsibilities, it feels hard to find time and emotional space for consistent practice. I also feel like it's a lot cruel to subject my family to my playing
on an kind of regular basis...

Maybe 2021 is the year I get back into it though.
