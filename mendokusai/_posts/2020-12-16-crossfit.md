In the spirit of both trying to say yes to new experiences and also getting ahead of the sort-my-life-out-in-January rush, today I tried Crossfit for the first time. After having not
been to a regular gym in 18 months, it was pretty brutal, although I surprised myself by not being as weak as I'd expected. The whole thing is a little bit rah-rah-rah, militaristic,
hate-yourself-into-the-best-version-of-yourself, but providing you don't pay any attention to that it's pretty fun. Getting an intense workout in in just an hour is nice, and the class
aspect is nice to support/push one another. It was good to break out my squat shoes too, which have been accumulating dust. Hopefully I'm not too sore tomorrow, but overall, I would
definitely recommend giving it a go.
