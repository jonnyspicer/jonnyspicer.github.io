<span >I wrote yesterday about patience being one of the keys to success, and how I had too little of it. Poker makes this abundantly clear to me - after feeling like I was finally making good progress last week, a couple of things this week have made me realise I still suck. In reality, I probably have made some progress, just not as much as I had first thought, and making that progress has shown me how much further improvement is possible and necessary. My frustration comes from false entitlement and expectations. I feel entitled to be a consistent winning player, because I work hard, but poker doesn't care how hard I work, I am entitled to nothing. I expect as a "professional" (I still loathe calling myself this, I prefer "full-time") poker player to be actually making a living off it - much like I would if I were a professional in anything else. Neither feeling is particularly helpful.&nbsp;</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Even if I feel I am impatient, I am forced to be patient now. I can't force anything, and I'm not planning on doing anything other than playing poker for the foreseeable future, so I am stuck here trying to make sure I take more steps forwards than I do backwards.</span>
