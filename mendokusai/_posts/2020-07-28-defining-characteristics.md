Today, a girl I went on a couple of dates with last year used "partial to a bit of fencing" as my 
defining characteristic, and I found it hilarious. I'm not even particularly sure why - I think it was that I didn't really remember
talking to her about fencing very much, or just didn't expect that to be the thing that stayed with her about me. It did make me
think though - what would I like my defining characteristic to be? Would I like future girls from future dates to refer to me as
"partial to a bit of social justice?" "Partial to some witty banter?" "Partial the sound of his own voice?"

Maybe not so much the last one, but I think it's a fun(ny) mental exercise to undertake.
