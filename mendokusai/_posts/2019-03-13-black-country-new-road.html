  Continuing my theme of weird but amazing music recommendations, today's is
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIP62_0htow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Black Country, New Road</a> of whom the only adjectives I can think of to describe
  are "avant garde" and perhaps "freeform". Either way, I am a big fan of their
  first single, "Athen's, France" and they're going straight on the list of bands
  I wanna see perform live.
