This year was my second attempt at the Guernsey half marathon, and I have to say, I enjoyed this one a whole lot more. Despite being very worried I was undertrained, I didn't suffer
anywhere near as much as I did last year, and I'd even go as far as to say I enjoyed the majority of it.

With that being said, I am not thrilled by the prospect of having to do that twice, back to back, in just seven weeks time. I'm going to do my best to train as well as I can in that
relatively short space of time, but I am expecting the full marathon distance to yield a good deal of suffering.
