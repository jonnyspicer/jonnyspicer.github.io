The parking situation at the local hospital is, frankly, a fucking nightmare. It's always so full that not only are there no spaces, but cars are scattered all over the shop, protruding onto the
roads and paths and just making the whole experience unnecessarily cumbersome.

There is however, a staff car park. The forbidden fruit - an oasis of gravel and opportunity amidst
the frozen tundra of why-are-there-never-any-fucking-spaces. 

So I parked there, because life is too short not to. Fuck the rules.
