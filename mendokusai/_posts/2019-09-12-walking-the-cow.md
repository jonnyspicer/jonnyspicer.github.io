It feels fitting that I learned of Daniel Johnston's passing while wearing my Car Seat Headrest t-shirt, given Will Toledo's
numerous [references to him](https://genius.com/Car-seat-headrest-feel-like-daniel-johnston-lyrics) and clear influence thereof. Toledo wasn't Johnston's only famous fan, the most well-known of whom was almost certainly Kurt Cobain, but the reaction to today's
news shows that he was beloved by musicians of every ilk.

I absolutely share Toledo's admiration - perhaps not in the context of being a poet or a musician, but in terms of expressing myself.
Johnston's songs are so pure, so unpretentious, so unburdened by the expectations of society around him. The way he experienced the
world around him is expressed with relentless and refreshing honesty through his art, making his struggles with mental health and
unrequited love feel close to unbearably poignant.

When I grow up, I want to be like Daniel Johnston.
