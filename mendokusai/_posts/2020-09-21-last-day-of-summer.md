Today was gloriously sunny and hot here in Guernsey, but the weather is set to be grey and rainy for the next two weeks, and it seems like summer is finally over. I made the most of
it today, eating my lunch outside and going for a walk after work, and to be honest I am a little scared of the winter. I've loved spending time outdoors this summer more than I ever
have before, and I'm not sure what I'm going to do in its stead if it is cold and dark and wet, as it soon will be. I'm grateful I got to have the summer I did though, especially
during a time when few others experienced a fraction of the normalcy that I did, and hopefully the winter months will make me all the more appreciative next year, once the sunshine
rolls round again.
