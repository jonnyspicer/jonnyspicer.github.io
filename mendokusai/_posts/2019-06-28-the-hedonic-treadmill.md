I worry a little about the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill). Things have been going great recently,
but what if my baseline happiness is actually far lower than I am at currently, and a decline
in my wellbeing is inevitable? Today I don't feel as great as I have for much of the last 
month, even with very little reason - everything around me is  still wonderful. Hopefully it is
'just one of those days' and not my mood regressing towards the mean.
