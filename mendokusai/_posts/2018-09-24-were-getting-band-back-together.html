<span >And we're baaaaack. After a few months hiatus, I've decided to continue posting daily to this blog which nobody ever reads. The idea behind it is much the same as before, to encourage myself to share my thoughts and feelings, to practise communicating, to put myself out here on the internet in such a way that even if nobody does read it, anybody <i>could</i>&nbsp;read it. Perhaps that fact will change my actions and I can try and be a little more genuine in my face to face interactions with people.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >So... the blog is back on. But this is all you're getting for today, because I am sleep deprived AF from the Major. Until tomorrow, friends.</span>
