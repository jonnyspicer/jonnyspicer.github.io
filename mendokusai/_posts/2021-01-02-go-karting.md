Today I went go karting for the first time, another new opportunity I am incredibly grateful to have when few others do. I was pretty nervous beforehand but it was super, super fun
and I loved it, even if the track being wet added an extra challenge to the whole thing. It was good to do something with a bit of speed get the adrenaline pumping to blow away some
of the festive excesses, and I improved a lot throughout the session - although I still couldn't get a good line through the chicane *at all*, evidently I am not cut out to be a racer.
It was a great afternoon out, and one I hope to repeat in the future.
