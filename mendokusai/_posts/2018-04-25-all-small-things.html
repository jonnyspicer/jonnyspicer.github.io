<span >Another day when I have had to do my best to remember, that the only things worth clinging to are the small things. I think this is because I am usually so overwhelmed by the big, bad things, I don't have room for any big, good things in my consciousness, but there are always a few good, small things lying around just in sight that I can try to focus on them for a few minutes at a time.</span>
