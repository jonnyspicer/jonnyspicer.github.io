As much as I loathe the Internet of Things, raspberry pis are pretty neat, so I have dutifully ordered one of the new model 4s. I have some pretty exciting plans for it, including but not limited to;

- Setting it up as a [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/);
- Setting up [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/);
- Configuring it to allow my PC to wake-on-LAN, so I can power on and then remote into that machine via the Pi over the internet;
- Running a cron to check the status of this website;
- Configuring a cron that can send automated tweets on my behalf and hopefully do something funky and interesting, very much inspired by [Hunter Scott's DefCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAOOdYsK7MM).

I'll open source any of the code that I end up writing, and probably do a write up of any progress I make/challenges I face here. Wish me luck!
