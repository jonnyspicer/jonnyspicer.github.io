<span >These days it seems more socially acceptable to meet new people and make new friends via the internet. Recently it seems like more and more of my friends are "internet friends" and today I made two new ones, I think. I don't even know their real names - just their screen names - but it still feels good. The anonymity of virtual life takes so much pressure and anxiety out of the scenario, to the point where talking to new people and e-socialising is actually... kinda fun.</span>
