  When I first started this blog, it was solely to win a bet. The idea
  behind our blog-a-day last longer was in part that we could go back
  and read our old blogs, and see how our ideas had changed and how
  we'd grown as people.
</p>
<p>
  I totally won the bet.
</p>
<p>
  But recently, I have come to see the value in reflecting on some of
  my old posts, which was the motivation for the bet itself. So I wanted
  to write some posts where I revisit old writing, ideas, outlooks on life.
  These are obviously all relatively recent (unless I can dig out some old
  bits and pieces off since-deleted social media or similar), but I am surprised
  at some of the things I wrote mere months ago.
</p>
<p>
  Where better to start then with the first post on this blog, <a href="https://jonnyspicer.com/mendokusai/2017/10/16/gambling-and-catharsis.html">
  Gambling and Catharsis,</a> posted on 16th October 2017, a little over
  a year ago now.

  There isn't much that I say in that post that I haven't already said
  in this one, but the one thing that stands out to me is that I still
  obviously consider myself a poker player/gambler at the time. There is
  still hope there that I will make it work and be successful in that arena,
  which I have since abandoned. I'm not sure if it was naïveté, if I was
  putting on a front, if I knew I was doomed already or what. It's tough to
  say whether or not I miss that feeling, or want it back, or wish I was still
  playing poker, if I could swap my current "career" for another shot at it,
  if I wish I had had more success with the game.
</p>
<p>
  Either way - I learned a lot, about myself, about the world, and about life.
