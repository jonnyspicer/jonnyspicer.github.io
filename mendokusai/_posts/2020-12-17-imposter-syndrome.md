When I start my new job next month, I know that I am going to struggle greatly with imposter syndrome. We had a meet-the-team event last night, and beforehand I was already anxious
that this would be the first time they'd realised they'd made a huge mistake by hiring me. I know that it's very common, and that a big step towards dealing with it is working hard,
but I'm going to try to write about my experience with it as much as possible in the coming months.
