Today lockdown in Guernsey was announced and tomorrow it begins, leaving me exceptionally glad that I already froze a
batch of burritos today. A lot of friends have already been in contact though and that has left me feeling strangely
optimistic, perhaps it really will bring us all closer together in the end?

Either way, again I am reminded how lucky I am to work in software and that I can continue to work seamlessly from home.
