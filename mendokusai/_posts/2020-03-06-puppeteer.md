Today I finally had the chance to play around with Google's [Puppeteer,](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/){:target="_blank"} it's nifty Node library for manipulating a Chrome browser via API, head
optional. It's a powerful tool for automation, and getting it hooked up
to [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/){:target="_blank"} in order to automate website audits was virtually
painless. I'll definitely be using it a lot more to write tests for
my projects, expect to see some cools things in my repos soon.
