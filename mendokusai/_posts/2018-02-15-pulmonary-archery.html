<span >Pulmonary Archery is the 11th and final track on Alexisonfire's 2002 eponymous debut album.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >I pirated this song off Limewire sometime in 2006, back in the days when it was still difficult to torrent entire albums. I would simply look up an artist and download random songs of theirs that I could find in order to listen to them - whatever had seeds. Youtube was in its infancy, and I hadn't even heard of it yet, and instead me and my classmates would watch music videos on musicjesus.com. I remember watching the video for My Chemical Romance's "Welcome to the Black Parade" over and over and over again. I also remember watching some 50 Cent video several times because it featured numerous topless women and I'd yet to discover internet pornography. I was young, naive, and hadn't fallen in love with music yet.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I had a friend who was a couple of years older than me called Laura. I didn't have many friends back then so I appreciated her a lot, and we'd talk daily on MSN. At the time I think the only CDs I owned were Gnarls Barkley and Kaiser Chiefs, and I'd potentially pirated Arctic Monkey's first album. The songs on them were cool, and I liked them. But I didn't <i>love them.</i>&nbsp;One day Laura told me about a band called Alexisonfire. Already the name struck me - Alex is on fire? Poor Alex, I hope it turns out alright. It took me a few months before I even learned that it is actually said as if it were Alexis on fire. Though the sentiment still stood - I hoped Alexis was alright too.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >My parents got me an mp3 player for my birthday that year, seeing as I had started buying CDs and learning about music a little. Pulmonary Archery was the only Alexisonfire song I had been able to download, so I put it on there. The next morning, I played it as I walked to school. It was unlike anything I had ever heard before.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >If you have never listened to music with screamed vocals before, I think it takes most people a while to ease into. It's scary, intimidating in a way, it's a raucous and abrasive sound. Alexisonfire's first album was wonderfully lo-fi, which only added to the raw aggression of the screaming. But alongside those pained screams were beautiful clean vocals and interesting melodic guitar lines, features I would later learn are the defining features of the post-hardcore genre which I would fall in love with. This music was different to everything I had listened to before; it wasn't just something to tap my feet to. I felt a connection to it.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I wasn't even sure if I liked it at first. Like I said, screaming is not an easy thing to "like" to begin with. But I played it on repeat all the way to school, and all the way home that day. And all that week. I couldn't stop listening to Pulmonary Archery.&nbsp;</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I listened to the song again this morning. If I listen to a song too many times, I get bored of it, burned out on it. My taste in music changes with time and my mood, and I move on from bands and entire genres. I find a new band whose sound is fresh and unique to me, and binge on their collection until my aural thirst is satiated. But this song is different. I have never grown bored of this song. I could still listen to it on repeat all day. And when it came on this morning, it still made me feel the same way it did when I first heard it on my way to school 12 years ago.</span><br /><br />
