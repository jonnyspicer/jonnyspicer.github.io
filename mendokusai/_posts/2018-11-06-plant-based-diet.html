  Following on from my <a href="/mendokusai/2018/10/26/lifestyle-changes.html">
  post on Oct 26th,</a> I am planning on going a step further than cutting
  out red meat, and am going to at least try a fully plant-based, vegan
  diet. I signed the lease on a new flat yesterday with a friend, and move in
  on January 29th, so I have nearly two full months of research and planning.

  I have made these kinds of statements, especially about diet, many times before,
  and I have failed to follow through on them pretty much without exception.
  What will be different this time? I am hoping a change in living situation,
  combined with a roommate who has a generally pretty healthy lifestyle,
  will be a good start towards possible change. Perhaps the socially
  conscious nature of the change will help too, and maybe if I obnoxiously
  blog about it all the time, that will keep me accountable.

  Or maybe I'll just book a massive freeroll.
