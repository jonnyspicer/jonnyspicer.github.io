Last night I had the pleasure of playing [this guy](/mendokusai/2018/11/13/ego-in-chess) in the
league once more. It wasn't quite over in 18 moves... but it was close, only 22, and this time
he wasn't ill. He did still say something hilarious to me though, after my win (my third consecutively against him), "I don't know what it is, I always seem to get compromised positions
against you... I think you're a bad stylistic matchup for me".

Come on bro, just say I am better than you, it's not going to hurt - at least not physically... 
Once again it feels good to indulge in my own ego though.
