Whenever anyone asks me how I'm doing recently, I'm exceptionally reluctant to be
honest with them. Now, this is usually the case, because I'm usually alarmingly
miserable and I don't want to upset them by giving an emotionally-involved answer
to an innocuous question, but this time it's different; I'm doing fine, well even,
but I'm terrified of jinxing it.

I'm not even entirely sure why I feel this compulsion to admit to being doing
averagely at best, and I think there's probably different components of it. On
one hand I want to keep everybody's expectations of me fairly low (as always), and
if/when things do start to go wrong I don't want them to be surprised and think
"but Jonny was doing so well, and now he's depressed *again*?!" and get stuck
in some cycle of emotional support that grates on them and damages our
relationship. I also find it embarrassing when things fall apart - I see it as
a bad thing for my character that I can't keep things together and maintain my
own emotional stability. Ultimately I think that the longer I tell people things
are going well, the harder it becomes when I want to tell them that I'm struggling
again, and so it seems a lot safer to just not mention the good times.

It's nice to keep my own expectations down as well, minimising the potential
for disappointment while optimising the opportunities for pleasant surprise. Maybe
it sounds dumb, but recently pleasantly surprised is something I've felt almost
all the time. I'll be doing something totally mundane and I'll catch myself and
realise that I feel OK about today and I feel OK about tomorrow and I feel OK
about myself and about my life, and that's still a pretty novel feeling for me.
In a way, I'm not sure if I ever want that part of things to change.
