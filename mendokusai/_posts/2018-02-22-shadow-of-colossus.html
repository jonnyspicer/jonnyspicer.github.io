<span >I've spent my entire evening watching Day9 play through the new remastered edition of Shadow of the Colossus, and this game is disgustingly gorgeous. It looks genuinely like a painting. After Nier Automata last year I didn't think a prettier game would come out anytime soon, but this might just be one - video games really are an art from now. Who needs "outside" when I have this?</span>
