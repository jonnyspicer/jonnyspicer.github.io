Yesterday saw the release of Californian rapper Hobo Johnson's second full length project, building on his recent virality (and controversy) from Peach Scone ticking the Youtube algo's boxes and racking up a cool
15 million views since last year. Sitting oddly betwixt emo and hip hop, Johnson's music can only really be described as a manic episode accompanied by a four piece band, and as such I kinda love it. The
accompaniments reflect the rollercoaster nature of the lyrics, from bombastic highs of gang vocals and raucous brass, to minimalistic trap beats overlaid with whispered bars.

I admired the authenticity of Peach Scone and I continue to admire it on this album, Johnson does not shy away from the complex emotions of unrequited love and suicidal ideation, but always retains a certain sense
of optimism, that he will keep going and things will get better despite how he currently feels. The love songs are gut-wrenching and the bangers are, well, banging, and I think his music will strike a chord with
many who might be unafraid to articulate the feelings that he does. Overall the record is a very solid progression from his 2017 debut, and hopefully it brings him further mainstream recognition.

Score: 8/10
