Progress on my new video creation/editing project is going well, and I am super excited about it! So far I have five clips recorded, which are going to be for one series of clip-py type videos. Some need some editing, some need audio dubbing, I still need to play around with OBS some more but I ought to have all the clips for my first "big" video by midweek, hopefully I can get it edited on Thursday and posted it overnight, so it will be up Friday morning. I also have a different type of series planned which will have shorter videos comprised of one constant recording and either music/commentary over the top, the first of which I think also ought to be recorded and edited by Wednesday, and then posted overnight. I know full well nobody is going to watch these videos, but I think I have some interesting ideas and I am hoping I can produce something I am proud of.
