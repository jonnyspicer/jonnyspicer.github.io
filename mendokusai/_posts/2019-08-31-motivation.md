Motivation and discipline are a funny pair. I've never cracked the latter, and the former comes and goes like the tides. Right now I feel huge amounts of motivation to work on side projects and try to
improve my coding ability in my spare time, but I am aware that this feeling is fleeting and I should not put too much stock in it. I have a small handful of things I'd like to start, but now I am reluctant
to mention them here, as I don't want to fall into my habitual trap of starting something and not finishing it.

Perhaps this motivation can be channeled into discipline though. If I start something now, actually seeing it through would be immensely rewarding given my propensity to abandon projects halfway. I guess
there is only one way to find out.
