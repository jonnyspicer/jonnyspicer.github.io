It appears the break is over - in fact it lasted a lot less time than I'd anticipated. But, the fans have spoken, and who am I to
deny my loyal followers the quality content that they so crave?

On a more serious note, the biggest reason I decided to write again today, and probably again tomorrow, and the day after, is that
I spent some time reading through a handful of my old posts. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience - not because I am an even vaguely competent writer, but because they capture a snapshot of myself from the past. Revisiting all those moments in time was a surprisingly pleasant journey, and ellicited a string of wry smiles. There are many posts I have written here that I love and am proud of, and not continuing to write more seems like something I might regret.

One such post that I returned to was [The Honesty Problem](/mendokusai/2018/12/28/the-honesty-problem), which I wrote while very
much struggling at the end of last year. It talks plainly about how I am scared to admit to the people around me how low I was feeling, at a time when I felt isolated and alone, and in retrospect is pretty obviously a cry for help.

As it turns out, it somewhat worked. In the days that followed that post, I did tell my friends how bad things had gotten, how trapped I felt, and how afraid I was about the future. Funnily enough, none of them abandoned me or gave me any indication that I was
being a burden - in fact, it strengthened my relationships with them. In the time since, I have slowly been more honest with more people,
and the overwhelming sense of loneliness I felt barely 6 months ago has transformed into a feeling that I am surrounded at all times by people who love and care about me. While I once labelled the idea of being honest about how I feel as a "problem", it has since
allowed me to feel a stronger connection to someone than I have in years, that I didn't even think I had the capacity to feel.

So I was wrong on the 28th December 2018, and I'm immensely grateful I was. I like being wrong - sometimes at least. I've still got
further progress to make with honesty, but I am happy to rebrand it as a solution and not a problem.

See you tomorrow, friends.
