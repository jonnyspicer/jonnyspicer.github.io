On Friday night, I bought something online while fairly intoxicated, at about 4 in the morning. It's something I quite wanted and all in all I can afford it, so I am happy with
the purchase. In my inebriated state, I did my address *slightly* wrong, but the package arrived correctly today regardless.

The only thing is - it's massive. I have no space for it. I am deeply concerned I am going to have to sleep on it.

If only there was an option to disable your card between the hours of midnight and 6am, I can't help but feel it'd solve some problems...
