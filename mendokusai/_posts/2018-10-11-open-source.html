  I was inspired today by <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-went-from-newbie-to-software-engineer-in-9-months-while-working-full-time-460bd8485847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  this</a> Medium article. I know inspiration will fade quickly, but
  I am hoping I can hold onto at least one thing from this article -
  it is never to late to start contributing to open source.
</p>
<p>
  One of the reasons I am a web developer is because I care a lot
  about the internet - I want it to be fast, accessible, to connect
  people and to improve our lives. Contributing to open source
  technology might seem sinful to some people, particularly in
  other professions. Giving up my time and expertise, for free?
  Volunteering, but not for those in need, for other developers?
</p>
<p>
  Well, in my infinite ignorance, I think it's a noble cause. To have
  the opportunity to contribute to a large, growing, evolving codebase
  would feel amazing, and I am hoping I will have that opportunity soon.
  Imagine when I get my first patch in a big project... It's going to feel
  like a huge achievement.

  The article linked above says it's never to early to start contributing,
  and I suspect this is true, especially given I don't actually have to
  contribute code, nor do I have to contribute to a major library.
  There are some pretty massive projects out there with terrible documentation -
  Drupal, I am looking at you - so something like that seems like a natural
  place to start. Obviously I am not going to try to write documentation
  for Drupal though, because that would require understanding it, and honestly
  Drupal is nuts to me. My weekend homework (once this site is finished)
  is going to be researching the best way to start my open source journey -
  hopefully it is a long one.
