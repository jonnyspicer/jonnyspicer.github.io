Today I began moving out of the flat I've lived in for a little over a year and a half, moving my sofa back into my parents. The table from our living room has also gone and suddenly
there's so much space. I'm kinda sad to be moving out of here, I feel comfortable in these walls and made some good memories between them. Moving out does mean moving in somewhere else
though, and while that place is technically my parents' house, I am hoping that is only temporary, and soon I will have the excitement of living somewhere new, somewhere fresh,
somewhere I can start a new adventure from.
