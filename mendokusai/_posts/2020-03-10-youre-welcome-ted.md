Imagine trying to write a blog post needling one of your friends, but then misspelling misstepped and
not resizing any of your images so they all overflow their containers. It's truly remarkable I managed
to lose a bet to someone like that...

Anyway, you're welcome, and don't worry, I'll be dining on your dollar in return soon enough.
