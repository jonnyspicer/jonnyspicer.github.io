I'm a thoroughly mediocre cook and tend to just cook the same very small number of dishes on rotation for myself, when I bother to cook at all. Somewhat as a result, I get *really*
anxious about the prospect of cooking for other people, anyone at all, even if I am completely comfortable with them otherwise. I've avoided cooking for others as much as I can, but
recently I've come to realise what a shame that is; cooking a meal for someone is such a simple way to show someone you care about them, even when that's a feeling the people on both
sides of the communication might struggle with.

It's a candidate New Year's resolution - to cook as much for other people as possible.
