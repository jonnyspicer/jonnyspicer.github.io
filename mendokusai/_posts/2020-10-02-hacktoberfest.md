It's only the second of October, and already there's been [drama](https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/){:target="_blank"}
 and [mudslinging](https://joel.net/how-one-guy-ruined-hacktoberfest2020-drama){:target="_blank"} aplenty. There's no
doubt in my mind that it's causing a lot of problems for open source maintainers, but I think it's interesting and
pretty sad that they are so quick to blame Digital Ocean or a single Youtuber for the issue. It reminds me of plenty
of other, wider problems where people point to narrow solutions - can't the whole point of this be that the people
ruining Hacktoberfest are assholes, and we should try to teach them to not be like that, rather than point fingers
at the people who ultimately have good intentions?
