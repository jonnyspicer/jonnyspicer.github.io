title: Things I'm Looking Forward To After The Pandemic II&#58; Seeing Friends

The thing I'm most looking forward to after the pandemic is, without doubt, being able to see my friends again. While I am exceptionally fortunate to have been able to socialise
relatively freely with my friends in Guernsey for the last 6 months, some of the people I am closest to don't live on the island and plans to see them this year have been cancelled.
I think especially with Christmas coming up, usually a time when all my friends are back here even if only for a week, it'll feel strange and lonely without some of my favourite
familiar faces. As soon as it's feasible, I will definitely be making plans and booking flights for long overdue reunions.
