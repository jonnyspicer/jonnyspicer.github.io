<span >I've decided to take a little bit (more) of time off from playing poker, but I don't want to have a complete holiday, I think I would get bored of the beach pretty quickly. So I have been thinking about what I can do with my time and have decided to try and do several 24 hour "challenges" in different things, to see how much I can improve at a skill in just one day. So far my ideas are thus:</span><br /><span ><br /></span><br /><ul><li><span >Write a short story&nbsp;</span></li><li><span >Write a stand up routine or comedy sketch</span></li><li><span >Start a new speed game from scratch and submit to the speedrun.com leaderboards by the end of the day</span></li><li><span >Get my blitz chess rating up as much as possible, follow a study plan</span></li><li><span >Improve my Spanish in as much as possible, with some kind of tangible goal at the end, either to write a poem in Spanish, translate my short story into Spanish, have some kind of spoken conversation etc.</span></li></ul><div><span ><br /></span></div><div><span >Good luck me.</span></div>
