<span >Throughout my life, I have been often failed to finish what I started, and often gave up when things became difficult. I have been thinking a lot this week whether or not I want to continue playing poker or doing something else. This morning I remembered that several times over the past few months I have promised myself I will keep playing poker until I absolutely cannot any longer. So, I'm going to take some more time off to compose myself further, and then back to finishing what I've started.</span>
