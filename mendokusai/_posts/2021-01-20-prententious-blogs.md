I have been struggling with the feeling that all my blog posts are painfully pretentious recently, the Joy Division one the other day springs to mind. Given that I'm not particularly
depressed at the moment, it feels difficult to write about anything authentically, and writing about anything inauthentically leaves a bad taste in my mouth. With the exception of
yesterday, I think I have strayed fairly far away from writing about what I am feeling on a day to day basis once again. At least now I have started my new job I want to write a lot
more about that, so hopefully I can make a successful return to form in the next few days or weeks.
