  Today is Valentine's Day and traditionally that means I make some kind of
  miserly comments on the internet. This year however I plan on toning it down,
  at the very least. I would say I would put on a face of positivity and maturity,
  but I have already sent some of my friends a picture of ice cream and the Pornhub
  homepage on my PC, so... it's too late for that.

  But while I am going to spend the evening eating enough to make myself sick
  and then masturbating until comatose, this year I am actually feeling better
  about things than I usually might. Sure, I am very, very single, but I feel
  better about myself and about my romantic prospects than I have in years. I
  don't feel (as) bitter towards those around me celebrating their shared happiness -
  it's almost cute. I'm not as insecure, and the fear of loneliness is abating.
  Perhaps next year I will have someone to celebrate my love for on this day.

  Or perhaps I'm just kidding myself.
