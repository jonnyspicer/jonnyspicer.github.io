I've been thinking a lot recently about how despair isn't useful. It's something that I think I gravitate towards in a lot of situations, because it's a way of shirking
responsibility, of not setting myself up for failure if I actually try to change things, instead telling myself that things are hopeless. Maybe it's a habit borne of privilege,
I can whine and not take action, and not only is my situation rarely actually that bad to begin with, often someone else will pitch in and deal with it for me. But that's dumb,
and not good enough anymore, so no more despairing inaction for me.
