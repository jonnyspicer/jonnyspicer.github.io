I've always thought that all my thoughts served some kind of purpose, were there for a reason, were at least worthy of being examined even if ultimately I was not going to let myself
be swept along by them. I've always thought refusing to acknowledge some thoughts would lead them to fester, to linger in my subconscious, to do more do more damage in the shadows
than they might if I were to try and confront them head on. My therapist howeever, disagrees, and says sometimes we just need to banish thoughts that aren't helpful to us. It's been
really positive to be given permission to simply cast some thoughts into the abyss. Not everything needs to be analysed, gone over, understand through and through in order to move past
it. Some thoughts, it turns out, can just be consigned to oblivion.
