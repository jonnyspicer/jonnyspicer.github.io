There have been many times in my life where I have felt directionless, and now is one of them. It seems important to make progress, to grow as a person, but at the moment I'm not so
clear as to which direction I'm heading in, or even which way I want to be going. My aspirations feel more tempered by realism than they have in the past - obviously anything that
involves leaving the island is out. I know any change needs to start really, really small and build from there, because if not I'll get overwhelmed.

As always, I kinda think I'm overthinking it. Happiness is the journey, not the destination, and I think there's a lot of happiness to be derived from being present (and perhaps
even enjoying the chaos) rather than trying wishing to be somewhere else.
