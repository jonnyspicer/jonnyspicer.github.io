<span >The basic PHP for Aubury is pretty much done, with only a couple small jobs left. The biggest thing I have to do is have it import arrays from .csv files but I'm hoping that should be pretty straightforward. He has some basic HTML to support him on a test server atm, although using PHP was not the optimum choice, it would be far better to do this client side in JavaScript. Perhaps one day I will transmogrify Aubury into another language. Hopefully by the end of tomorrow I will have a working prototype.</span>
