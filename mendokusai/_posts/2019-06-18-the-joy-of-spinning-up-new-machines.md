Today I had the pleasure of taking a fresh Win10 install and transforming it into a usable development environment - furthermore, my own development environment.
Starting from clean installs is actually super fun in my experience, somewhat akin to giving your machine a Cinderella-esque makeover, by the end she's complete
with glass slipper IDEs, silken gown CLI tools and a splendid dark-theme-everything wig. I even got Windows Terminal to build and run correctly, so I now have a
tabbed CLI on Windows without using a console emulator, which is ~very exciting~ something I can't believe we've collectively had to wait this long for.

My productivity is definitely gonna be at least 10% higher now I have like 20 new VSCode extensions installed too - the code is so pretty!
