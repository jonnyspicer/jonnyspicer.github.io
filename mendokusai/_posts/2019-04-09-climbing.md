Yesterday I went to a climbing gym for the first time and I cannot recommend it
highly enough. [The Island Rock gym](https://islandrock.com/) was an awesome
facility and was perfect for a total novice like me, with some incredibly easy
routes right next to some exceptionally challenging ones, making it possible
to watch veteran climbers on the latter and aspire to something greater.

I was awful, but I did at least manage to successfully complete one V0 boulder
problem and one V6 top rope route. My hands are banged up and my forearms are achingly
sore even today, but it was comfortably worth it. Aside from the enjoyable
physical aspect of climbing, my favourite thing, especially as both a complete
beginner and also an anxious child, was being able to overcome my fears and
get all the way to the top of the wall, even though I have a healthy sense
of vertigo. The trick, I have discovered, is not to think about it and not to
look down!
