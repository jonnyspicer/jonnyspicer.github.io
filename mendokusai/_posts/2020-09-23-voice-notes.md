I remember when I first moved to Mexico and discovered that people who aren't from the UK do this weird thing where they *send each other voice notes* like barbarians rather than
just texting each other like civilized members of society. I found the practice bizarre - where texting had been so comfortable, why make yourself so vulnerable by infusing your
voice into something so trivial? There's so much more information in a voice note than a text message, you get access to far more of my emotional state than I have control over by
simply choosing what words to put in what order. In short, you wouldn't catch me dead sending you a voice note.

Obviously, I did a complete u-turn and voice notes are now my absolute favourite. I love being able to hear the voice of one of my friends rather than hear my brain's approximation of
it when I read their messages, and that's doubly true for my friends in far-flung places. The British preference for texting is the true barbarism here.
