The other day one of my friends described me as "a calm soul", and it was an odd moment for me, because it didn't ring true at all, especially coming from someone who is usually
unpleasantly perceptive. I know I try my damnedest to remain externally calm at all times, but inside it's pretty non-stop tumult (is that a self-absorbed tihng to say?). I
don't know if I want to be a calm soul either; calm is *boring*. Anger is righteous, eat the rich, burn the man etc.
