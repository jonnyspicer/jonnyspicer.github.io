Uncharacteristically, I appear to have righted the shape when it comes to my mental health lockdown. Obviously it's only been 10 days, but usually when it starts going wrong for me,
it's an unstoppable downward slide, so I'm pleasantly surprised to report that I don't feel sad all day every day. I think the biggest thing for me has been establishing a new routine,
as disruption of my old one was one of my biggest worries when lockdown began. I get up at the same time, try to do some exercise every day, work, take a full hour for lunch, do
something to relax away from my computer in the evening. I also have start using my fancy noise-cancelling headphones a lot more... Lockdown doesn't feel so bad right now, and I feel
like it might be a lot more sustainable than I thought a week ago.
