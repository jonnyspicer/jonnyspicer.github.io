Recently I've been missing fencing, or at least sort of. There were a lot of things that frustrated me throughout my
fencing career, not least of which was that my results rarely matched my expectations, but there was a feeling I had
when I fenced that was unlike any other. Whenever I walked into a training session I became a different person, my
posture changed, I stood tall, I joked and danced and talked to anyone and everyone. I was confident in a way in which
I've never been in any other arena in my life, apart from maybe while several drinks deep with friends.

Much as I wish the feeling I have inside of a float tank would persist, I similarly wish I could transplant the feeling
of being in a fencing hall into every other space in my life.
