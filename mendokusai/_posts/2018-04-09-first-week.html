<span >Five things I have learned during my first week as a web "developer" (aka web dev studio office bitch):</span><br /><span ><br /></span><br /><ol><li><span >Planning your code is VERY important</span></li><li><span >Sometimes something will break, and you will fix it, and in the process you will break something seemingly unrelated, repeat ad infinitem</span></li><li><span >You can fix a problem crudely and produce the desired result in the short term, but your future self will appreciate an elegant solution far more</span></li><li><span >Sometimes you will fix something by accident, and have no idea how or what you did</span></li><li><span >Not being able to fix something, working on the problem and then finding a solution is an <i>unbelievably</i>&nbsp;satisfying feeling</span></li></ol>
