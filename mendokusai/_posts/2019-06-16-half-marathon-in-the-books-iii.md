After [signing up on Monday](/mendokusai/2019/06/10/half-marathon-in-the-books-ii), today was the day, and I lined up at L'Eree with over
800 other people to run the 13.1 miles around the top half of the island before being back to town. I previously wrote that I was hoping
to enjoy the first 10 miles, and perhaps unsurprisingly, I didn't - things started sucking a lot around mile 7, before they started *really*
sucking at mile 10. I didn't really taper for this run (or even do much of the right kind of training) so I'm not sure what else I expected.
The important thing is ~I beat the guy wearing a hippo suit~ that I finished, despite quite how grim things were between Bordeaux and the finish.
During those final few ks, I once again asked myself why I was putting my body through this experience, as it was far from enjoyable, but even
a couple of hours after the race was over I was already thinking about my next long run, goals, times etc.

And now, my focus really *is* on the 10k in September, a far more palatable distance.
