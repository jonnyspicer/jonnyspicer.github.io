  Movie reviews are back! I watched a few films over the holiday period, so here
  they are.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn</strong>
</p>
<p>
  I wanted to watch this film purely because of the people in it, namely Aubury
  Plaza, Jermaine Clement, Craig Robertson and Matt Berry. I'd honestly watch
  anything with Aubury in it, and so I tried to learn as little about the plot
  as possible beforehand, I didn't even watch the trailer.
</p>
<p>
  This film is <i>weird.</i> I'm not sure how else to describe it, other than
  bizarre, at times hilarious, at others human and emotional. It was everything
  I wanted out of it and I loved every second, but... I can't recommend it to
  you. Unless you have the same penchant for oddity I do, you will not enjoy
  this film I'm afraid.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Fargo</strong>
</p>
<p>
  After having watch this film, I have dedicated 10 minutes in front of my mirror
  every day to perfecting my Minnesotan accent. It still sucks, but it's totally
  worth it.
</p>
<p>
  Obviously this didn't come out in 2018, so it's more of a classic, but I
  also enjoyed it a lot. Another strange movie, but this time one I absolutely
  would recommend - thrilling and hilarious, it heartily delivers on an evening
  of dark fun while giving you something to think about too. I hope you don't
  enjoy resolution, because you will still have plenty of questions left by the
  end, especially regarding whether the movie is as true as it claims to be; but it is
  well worth watching either way.

  <strong>Eighth Grade</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Given that this film was made by one of my heroes, and got onto <a href="https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10156393283416749"
  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Barack Obama's top films of 2018</a>, I had
  very high hopes for Eighth Grade, and was relieved that it still smashed them out
  of a park. It scares the hell out of me how much I related to the 13 year old
  female protagonist at points in this film, but I defy any millenial to say they
  don't. This is the first time I have seen issues I have felt affected me personally
  displayed on the big screen, as Bo Burnham beautifully shows the pains of puberty
  in the social media age. 10/10, absolutely recommended.
