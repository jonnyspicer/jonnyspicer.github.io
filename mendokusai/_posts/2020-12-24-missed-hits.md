Recommendation algorithms get a lot of very justified negative attention, but when done well they can be wonderful. I've finally got round to my "Missed Hits" playlist on Spotify this
year, containing 30 songs from artists who I've never listened to, and I've loved every single one. For all the evils of AI, it's nice to be reminded that it could be used to help
people discover things they love, and bring them genuine joy.
