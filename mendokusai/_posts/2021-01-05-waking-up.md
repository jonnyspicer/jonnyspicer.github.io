I have always hated getting up in the mornings. I would quite happily spend half my waking life in my bed, and when I've been depressed enough, I've spent a good deal more than that.
I've also never particularly subscribed to the idea of getting up early as a silver bullet for achieving all your life goals, but I am once again planning on trying to shift my alarm
from 8am to 6am over the coming weeks. As I transition from infinite free time to working a 9-5 again, having a couple of hours before work just for myself in the morning seem like
a precious thing. For a couple of weeks I know it is going to absolutely suck though - I have no idea how people do it, but I want to be one of those people somehow.
