It’s very early days but so far I am very happy with how I am finding intermittent fasting and loosely “dieting”. I am super sore from running yesterday but hopefully I’m going to feel recovered enough tomorrow to try to start a couch to 5k programme. Fingers crossed I can keep this up and make some sustainable good habits.
