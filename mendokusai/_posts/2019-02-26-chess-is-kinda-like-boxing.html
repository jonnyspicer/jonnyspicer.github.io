  Recently I came to understand something pretty important about chess (or at least,
  how to win at chess) - that it is a fight. In order to have the best results, you
  have to sit down at the board the same way you'd step into a boxing ring - knowing
  that you're going to take some hits, that it's not going to be easy, but
  ultimately that if you persevere and give it your all, you can triumph. Mindset is
  huge - unintuitively so in a game as logical as chess - but I really think it can
  probably make 200 - 300 ELO points of difference, maybe more.

  Tonight, I am physically, emotionally and mentally exhausted, and I face the
  island champion in my league match. The odds are certainly not in my favour,
  but I'm determined to make it a fight.
