title: Think Deeply About Simple Things
tags: [ Software Development ]

I heard the notion to "think deeply about simple things" recently in relation to maths, but it applies
just as much to software, as well as life. In the two technical fields, our knowledge is built on a
foundation of layers of paradigms, and often we are unquestioning of these - we assimilate them into
our cognitive processes before we have the tools necessary to ask the right questions, and later in our
development, we are simply not in the habit of challenging our own assumptions.

Building this habit is well worth doing, especially in software, where it seems that the paradigms are
at best messy, and at worst detrimental to our ability to write high-quality software. Object-oriented vs
procedural programming is still a debate which many people have strong opinions about, and nobody has
an especially clear answer to. Languages all have their pros and cons, and due to their proliferation
in the wild, collective knowledge is spread thin between them.

All this means that when it comes to solving problems, we have so much noise to cut through before
we even get down to conjuring a solution, which ultimately means less deep thought is put into said
solution. Having started Leetcode 30 days of code challenge this month, it's painful clear to me that
I need to think deeply about a problem (which is often a simple problem) before I start actually writing
any code, otherwise it'll end up being slow, inefficient and painful. Completing the challenge solely
in C# is rapidly becoming a choice I regret, as I realise quite how slow it is and how much memory it
uses - this is even outside of a large .NET project running on Windows which inevitably introduces
inordinate amounts of bloat to the equation. Simply stopping and asking yourself "why?" several times
before beginning to tackle a problem, and trying to evaluate what assumptions you are making in the
process is going to be a valuable exercise in improving as a programmer.

The same is true for life - I find myself often very caught up in the minutiae of my existence, and
think that my happiness is dependent on some precarious spider's web of interconnecting threads, but
that is obviously not the case. I think that, because I have not really yet begun to think about the
problem. Naturally, I think society is out to get us on this one - it does not exactly reward deep
contemplation on the basics of life, and rams down our throat the idea that every detail is of critical
importance to our content - but that doesn't mean we can't beat it. I think human beings are
fundamentally simple creatures with simple wants - houseplants with complicated emotions, as the
kids would say - and I suspect if I spend more time thinking deeply about these simple desires, I might
find myself meaningfully happier.

### Three more things to be grateful for

- [Errichto's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBr_Fu6q9iHYQCh13jmpbrg){:target="_blank"}
for so clearly explaining algorithms and Leetcode problem solutions;
- Being able to work from home so easily and seamlessly;
- [myNoise](https://mynoise.net){:target="_blank"} for having a huge catalogue of soothing sounds to
both keep my company and distract me from the madness of the outside world.
