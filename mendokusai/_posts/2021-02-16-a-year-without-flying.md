The last time I took a flight was February 2020, from Birmingham back to Guernsey, a year ago today. Trying to think back, I can't remember the last time I went a year without flying -
it's quite possible this is the first time in my life that's been the case. I had plenty of other plans to take flights in 2020, but obviously none of them
materialised. While I might have thought previously that a whole year spent on Guernsey would've been claustrophobic and stifling (and there have certainly been moments of that),
overall the pandemic has made me appreciate a lot of things about the island that I'd previously taken for granted. It's one of the most naturally beautiful places I've ever been, and
it's all right on my doorstep, the sea and the cliffs being only a short walk away at any time. I'm going to miss it so much when I'm gone, and I'm doing my best to make the most of it
now, while I still can.

Of course, there are plenty of reasons I am excited to leave, and plenty of things that I decidedly won't miss about Guernsey. My next flight is looking likely to be in late April or
early May, and I expect it to be one of the more stressful ones I've taken to date, as I try to cram my worldly belongings into a suitcase and navigate the commercial aviation
experience without contracting corona. Once in London, as the restrictions are hopefully easing, the world will be my oyster, and when it's safe to do so, I have a long list of places
I want to fly to.
