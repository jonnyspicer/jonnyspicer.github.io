  In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</a> was the second and last album by the mysterious
  and oddly-named Neutral Milk Hotel, released in 1998 to little commercial success
  initially. Over the years however, its popularity has grown massively, and the
  record is now a critics' favourite, appearing on numerous
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Aeroplane_Over_the_Sea#Accolades" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  'Top X' style lists.</a>

  For all its influence and acclaim, this album is... weird. It has a wonderfully
  lo-fi quality to it, and some of the instrumentation is uncommon - for example
  the uilleann pipes, which I had to Google (they're Irish bagpipes). Then there's
  the lyrics, which are abstract and <a href="https://genius.com/Neutral-milk-hotel-communist-daughter-lyrics" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  sometimes sexual in a very confusing way.</a> The most bizarre thing about the
  album is without doubt that it appears to chronicle frontman Jeff Mangum's fascination
  with Anne Frank, including the line:
</p>
<p>
  <blockquote>
      I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Which seems like a strange premise for an album, but Mangum was apparently greatly
  moved by Frank's story, and understandably so. He seems like a odd dude, and
  its an odd album.

  But the critics are absolutely right - this is one of the best records ever made.
  It's beautiful and evocative, despite its bizarre nature. The fact that it is so
  rough around the edges lends a sense of authenticity to the music, allowing the
  listener to emotionally connect with it. It is 39 minutes of raw, unfiltered
  human expression, and that is what art should be, even if you don't agree or
  empathise with what the artist is expressing. This is a true masterpiece, one
  of the greatest albums ever made. Go listen to it.
