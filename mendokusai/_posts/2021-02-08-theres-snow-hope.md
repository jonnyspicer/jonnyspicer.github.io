Upon waking this morning, I was struck by the thought that *it's fucking cold*. I'm wearing two pairs of socks, and two jumpers, indoors. Outside, temperatures are in the low single
digit celsius (my phone reckons it's 1 degree above freezing at the time of writing) and are forecast to remain there all week. This means that there is the (slim) possibility of snow.

I don't think I've seen snow since 2018, when it snowed here in Guernsey in March. I miss it a lot, and when it's safe to go traveling again, I'm hopeful to go skiing. The island is
especially beautiful when it's clad in white, and I think for many it would provide a much needed moment of joy during lockdown.
