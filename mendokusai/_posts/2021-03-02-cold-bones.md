Now we are approaching spring, I am incredibly grateful for the longer days.
Being able to see the sunlight as soon as I wake up in the morning, as well as
catch some of it after my work day has finished, is a welcome boon for my
wellbeing.

With that being said, it's still cold. Well, coldish - Guernsey is still hovering
between 5 and 10 degrees this week. But I am sick of it, I feel cold from the
moment I get out of bed until I return to it in the evening. At that point my
sheets are similarly chilly and unpleasant against my skin, as I try to wrap
myself into a sufficiently-snug burrito that I might warm my immediate
surroundings. Never being warm takes its toll, and I feel like even my bones
are cold.

I am very excited for the warmth that spring and summer brings, and even more
excited for a time when I'll be able to escape to warmer, international climes.
