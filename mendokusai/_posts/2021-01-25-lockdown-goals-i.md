title: Lockdown Goals I

I really want to keep exercising as much as I can in lockdown, although right now my motivation is squarely 0. I have a couple of small goals though; be able to do 30 pushups in a
minute, and be able to do a handstand (with my feet against the wall) for 30 seconds. I use a pomodorro timer at work so I have a 5 minute break every 25 minutes, and I'm going to
use it to try and hit those goals, maybe with some planks thrown in too.
