This is probably gonna sound super pretentious, but w/e... contrived, posed photos annoy me far more than I know they should. In pursuit of doing it for the 'gram,
something about trying so hard and taking yourself way too seriously irks me like nothing else. Maybe I'm just jealous because whenever I never know what to do with my
hands in photos, idk?

Candid photos on the other hand, make me so happy. Trying to capture a genuine moment with one of my friends, be it a smile, a grimace at the exceptionally off-colour joke
I just told, or just something goofy, brings me a lot of joy and I think is far more rewarding than trying to find the best angles and the perfect lighting.
