This evening I am delighted to report that I have the opportunity to play in a home game, which may in fact be the second most +EV spot I've ever been in - the first is naturally this bet. I can't remember the
last time I played holdem, and the format is going to be essentially hyper SNGs, but these people won't even be able to spell ICM, and I smell blood in the water. Hopefully tomorrow I will be able to treat myself to
a nice steak dinner with their money.
