At the expense of being preachy about yoga now (sorry - I know the list gets ever longer), since taking it up during lockdown, I've found it definitely has some amount of therapeutic
benefit. Aside from the fact that it feels good to move my body, especially in a way that is at least aiming for poise and grace, it's helped my quiet my oft loud thoughts of past
and future. Even first thing in the morning, I usually wake up with a hundred things on my mind, left over from the night before or freshly minted in my dreams, all violently
jockeying for my attention. Yoga's focus on the breath goes some way to turning the volume down in my head, and I almost always find myself feeling better emotionally as well as
physically after I've practiced.
