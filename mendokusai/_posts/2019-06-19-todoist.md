I have documented various flippings and floppings centred around to-do lists many times previously, but over the past month or so I've had a fair amount of success
with the Todoist app, so much so that I would tentatively recommend it. It has some neat features, even in the free version, allowing you to separate your tasks into
different categories and set recurring daily, weekly or similar errands. There's also a karma system which you can use to gamify your productivity. I've found the trick
is to make each duty as small as possible, and ideally try to have several to do at all times - this way you can easily make your way through a few at a time, and tap
into the feeling that you have achieved something meaningful, and there are also plenty that you can squeeze in during 5 spare minutes, while the list hopefully never
becomes overwhelming as there is always a quick win which can be achieved.
