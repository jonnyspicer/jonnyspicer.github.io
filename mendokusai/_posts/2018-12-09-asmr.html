  Over the last couple of months I have discovered the wondrousness of ASMR - more
  specifically, watching and listening to videos which are designed to promote
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response.</a> I listen to an 'intentional' ASMR video
  every night in bed, and I can honestly say I think they have massively improved
  my quality of sleep, and my ability to get to sleep quickly.
</p>
<p>
  ASMR is a little strange though. When I typed it into DuckDuckGo to double check
  what it stood for, one of the top results is a porn site, where ASMR is actually
  listed as a category. I've not watched ASMR porn (yet?) but I can understand the
  appeal - ASMR is very intimate in nature, and can have a very personal feel.
  After all, someone is essentially whispering in your ear.
</p>
<p>
  I am also slightly ashamed of my newfound love, because I think part of the reason
  I enjoy it so much is precisely because of the intimacy it offers. I mostly listen
  to videos of women whispering, and it's... pretty embarrassing to admit, when I
  phrase it like that. A lot more so than if I talked about the kind of thing I
  watch women do in porn, which seems kinda backwards.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from the actual 'tingles', which are amazing, ASMR aficionados proclaim
  some of its greatest benefits are on those suffering with mental health problems,
  and in my personal experience I would have to agree. When you are feeling anxious,
  stressed or low, someone whispering comforting things (or even total nonsense)
  in your ear is a welcome and calming distraction.
</p>
<p>
  Next time you are struggling to sleep, I would definitely recommend trying to be
  open minded and trying an ASMR video.
