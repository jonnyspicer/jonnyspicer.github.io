  Today, this afternoon in particular, I have been in a pretty good mood - this
  is of grave concern. Usually when I am in a good mood, there has been a correspondingly
  positive recent event that has played a role in my chirpy demeanour, but today
  that is not the case. Nothing whatsoever out of the ordinary has happened in
  the past week, and so this change in my tune has me worried. I am deeply
  suspicious of it. Is this the eye of the storm? Are things about to get much,
  much worse? Is my subconscious lulling me into a false sense of security before
  reducing every waking moment into a nihilistic oblivion later in the week?

  Or maybe things are actually getting better. But I doubt it.
