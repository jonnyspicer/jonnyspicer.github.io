  People are my religion.</a> Well, they are now at least. Having spent my entire
  adult life largely being a misanthrope, perpetually bitter at numerous perceived
  sleights, I am finally making an effort to get over myself.
</p>
<p>
  My loudly professed distate for humanity is a byproduct of my
  own insecurities is surely obvious to everyone but me. Perhaps it is even my
  Soul Toupee (or, one of them). It may have once served some purpose to insulate
  my fragile ego from the barbs of reality, but now it is obselete - and I would
  like to consign it to history, an artifact of my personality that is no more
  than a milestone for growth.

  In the past month or so, I have come to realise how pivotal other people are
  in my own happiness. Maintaining healthy, vulnerable relationships with the people
  that I care about is going to give me a feeling of connectedness that will stave
  off the icy grip of depression. Striving to be able to interact openly and easily with
  strangers and acquaintances is going to be integral to vanquishing my anxieties.

  Elon Musk high as a kite,</a> by my friend Ongun and by a great many other things,
  the hermetic life is not for me. As much as I would love to pretend that I am better
  than everyone around me, that I don't need them, today I begin to make a conscious
  effort to change that, to see the good in everyone, as corny as that might sound.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not going to flip and become a hippy or a Buddhist monk overnight - I'm sure
  I will still get angry and frustrated by people, and lash out sometimes. But
  the important thing is that I'm going to try to make a positive difference.
