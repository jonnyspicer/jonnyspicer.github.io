  This week I have finally started a proper powerlifting programme, rather than
  <a href="/mendokusai/2018/11/25/everyone-is-totally-winging-it" target="_blank">totally winging it</a> when I work out.
  It is a little different to your average programme though, it is in fact the
  <a href="https://www.jtsstrength.com/juggernaut-ai-coaching/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  Juggernaut 'AI' Coaching</a> programme. I put 'AI' in well-deserved quotes, because
  as far as I can tell, the only intelligence involved in its creation is purely organic,
  and the rest is done by a (presumably complicated) spreadsheet. If there is any
  truth in the meme that machine learning is just a massive tree of <code>if{}</code>
  statements... this really <i>is</i> a massive tree of <code>if{}</code> statements.

<p>
  With that being said, it is supposed to be a good compromise between a cookie cutter
  programme and one-on-one coaching in terms of customisation and price. I am very
  impressed with the number of factors it takes into account and how well it seems
  to handle each input. It seems to be a very good price for what it is ($27/month),
  in my opinion at least.

  I am very excited to get back into training 'properly' and hopefully start seeing
  some meaningful progress. I am a little scared though - there is a <strong>lot</strong>
  more volume in my upcoming weeks then I have been doing in the past few months!
  There's gonna be a lot of sore mornings this winter.
