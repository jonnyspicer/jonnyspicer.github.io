The other day, one of my teammates described himself as a "keen idiot", with regards to signing up to learn about new things at our company. I really liked the way he put it - he's
aiming for enthusiasm (which is great) but balanced with humility (also great). I often find myself wrapped up so much in not being an idiot, that my enthusiasm wanes, and suddenly
I'm apathetic and self-important, a toxic combination.

So, my new *mantra du jour*; I am a keen idiot.
