  As I'm sure you have noticed, today the site has an exciting new feature - colour!
  There is actually a slightly less obvious, but equally exciting, new feature that
  I have added today as well, which is a JavaScript file. I'd like to talk
  a bit about why I decided to add these two things to my site.
</p>
<p>
  Both new additions actually have a common objective, that of improving accessibility.
  In my opinion, accessibility is overlooked by a very large number of web devs,
  and there isn't really a good excuse for it. All that is required to make a site
  accessible is some education and a tiny amount of time, and if a site is built
  with accessibility in mind, the extra effort is negligible.
</p>
<p>
  The problem with my lovely CSS-only hamburger menus and accordions was that they
  were completely un-navigable with only a keyboard. Their current JavaScript-enhanced
  iterations aren't much better, but when I next have some time to work on the site,
  the improvements will allow full, and hopefully easy, keyboard navigation of
  the site.
</p>
<p>
  My monochrome design choices may have fit my minimalist <span style="white-space:nowrap;">【﻿ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ】</span> but
  a lot of the greys had poor colour-contrast, and my link styles were confusing and
  inconsistent. Now, with only a primary and alternate colour,
  every link on the site should look the same <i>and</i> they are suitably
  different from regular text.
</p>
<p>
  There is an element of compromise here - any JavaScript added will slow the
  performance of my site (although I have only added 15 or so lines so far, so
  the degradation will be infinitesimal), and I can no longer say the site is a
  no-JS-zone. With regards to the colours, I am not entirely sold on the actual
  hues I picked, at least not yet. It was a pretty tough decision, I wanted to pick ones
  that had solid contrast and were complementary, and avoid blue because everything
  on the internet is blue... Perhaps they will grow on me.
</p>
<p>
  The next wave of upgrades for this site will be to make it compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  WCAG 2.0 AA</a> standard. I am hopefully most of the way there already, but I
  am quite excited for the additional challenge, and I think I will learn a lot
  on the way.
</p>
<p>
  I have made these changes to the site because I believe the web should be for
  everyone, and developers have a responsibility to cater for anyone who wants
  or needs to use their site.
