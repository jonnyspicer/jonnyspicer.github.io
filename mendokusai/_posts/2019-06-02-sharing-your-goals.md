title: Sharing Your Goals

I am (in my own mind) notorious for not following through - my execution sucks. I set big goals, which I sincerely believe are
achievable, I tell everyone about them because I'm so excited, and I do great for a month or two, and then I lose steam and stop
making any progress. I think it's a trap a lot of people fall into, but I want to turn it around - I want to be the guy who
always underpromises and overdelivers, not the other round.

It's [pretty common advice at this point](https://blog.trello.com/science-backed-reasons-you-shouldnt-share-your-goals) to not
share your goals, so I'm going to try that.

I've got some big ones - but I'm not going to tell you what they are. You'll have to try and guess.
