title: Things To Write About

I've been really struggling to find things to write about recently, hence this piece of meta-commentary. I feel like I've been phoning it in quite a lot over the past couple of
months. Given the pandemic and my relative lack of restrictions, I don't really want to write too much about anything positive because it just seems kinda smug. By the same
turn, I don't really want to write anything about how bad everything is because firstly I am aware that I have it better than pretty much everyone in the world right now, and secondly
because there's enough people writing about that. Saying 2020 sucks isn't exactly a hot take.

The only two topics that I feel are important to talk about and I'm sufficiently knowledgeable on/have enough lived experience of are mental health/depression/anxiety and weight &
body image. And they're also both kinda just... fine. My body image is a struggle but it's a manageable one, I'm maintaining my current weight fairly consistently, exercising quite a
lot, eating fruit and vegetables but also ice cream. I'm not depressed, nor am I especially anxious, I'm finding ways to genuinely enjoy the time I spend in my own company, the
shorter days aren't affecting me as much as I'd feared they might. I feel fairly healthy, both physically and mentally. Which is fucking boring.

I don't know. Suggestions for blog topics welcomed & encouraged, otherwise I feel like they're going to really start going off the rails in the name of me trying to enjoy writing them.
