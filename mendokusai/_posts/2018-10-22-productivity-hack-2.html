  Having already brought you one high quality productivity hack this week,
  I am proud to announce that I have <i>another</i> awesome time-saver up
  my sleeve, ready to share with you all, like the benevolent god I am.
</p>
<p>
  I've already talked about how it isn't news that we spent too much time
  on our phones. Now I am talking about it again, it is <strong>doubly</strong>
  not news, anti-news if you will. But bear with me, this is a good one - this
  is a failsafe way to spend lost time on your phone, and all you need to do is
  install an app on your phone - in fact, you probably already have it!
  The app in question, perhaps surprisingly, is Snapchat.
</p>
<p>
  "But Jonny, how is having Snapchat installed going to help me waste less time,
  be more productive, and overall improve my pitiful life?" I hear you, a mere and
  feeble time-management mortal, ask. Well, let me tell you - everytime you open
  your phone, go to the Snapchat app, and then swipe right, to Discover or Stories
  or whatever-the-fuck-its-called. Now, DO NOT watch the stories of any of your
  actual friends or contacts. Instead, watch one of the Snapchat-curated featurettes,
  likely entitled "which celebrity has the curviest toes?" or "OMG you won't believe
  what Katy Perry's favourite kind of pasta is!".
</p>
<p>
  You probably still don't understand how this helps, but stick with it. Continue
  watching the shiny, clickbaity, cleavage-intensive wonder-garbage being beamed
  to you from the SnapFactory. Once you have got to the end, you will have lost
  100% of your faith in humanity. You will want to gouge your eyes out, but before
  doing so, you will want to gouge out the eyes of whoever produced the 90 second
  shitfest you just watched, before throwing your phone into a pit of boiling
  lava and nosediving after it.
</p>
<p>
  After having recovered from this brief moment of all-encompassing rage, you
  will close the app, turn off your phone, and get back to work.
