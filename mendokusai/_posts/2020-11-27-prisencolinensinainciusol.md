I feel like we're all often in need of distractions from the world at the moment, and today I found a pretty good, albeit short one. Please enjoy [Prisencolinensinainciusol,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g6YxkSqL20){:target="_blank"} a song that according to Wikipedia was meant to sound to its Italian audience like it was discernable English with an American
accent, while in fact being completely nonsensical. As a native English speaker, it also sounds to me like it ought to be an English song, and my brain is desperately trying to pick
out familiar words where there are none.

There's probably some deep and meaningful point that it's making about language and communication as well, but I'm nowhere near smart enough for that.
