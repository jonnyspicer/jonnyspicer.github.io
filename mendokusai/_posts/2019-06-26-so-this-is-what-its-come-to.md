Apparently, [this](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/hey-advertisers-track-this/) is now the way that we're fighting aggressive ad
tracking practices. Now, I know it's mostly a joke - and also it's not like a huge amount of Mozilla dev time has gone into this, I'm
sure it was knocked out in a couple of hours in one Friday afternoon. But, are the people who are still fighting for a free Internet really
advocating such ridiculous practices in order to circumvent tracking? I guess it is good to be able to poke fun at oneself, but in this
instance I think the scary thing about the joke is how worryingly believable as reality it is.
