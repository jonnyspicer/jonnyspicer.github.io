<p>
  I am pretty sure I have already written a post to this exact effect but whatever,
  it is what has been on my mind today and so I want to write about it (again).
</p>
<p>
  I miss painting my nails. The more I think about it, the more awesome it was. Sure,
  there were some uncomfortable moments - for example when my father asked me if I
  had begun painting them due to my 'mood'. The more I think about this question,
  the dumber I think it is. As my father, does he even need to question it? His
  tone was not entirely disapproving, but I knew he wished I had clear cuticles
  nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
  Another good one was when I was coaching at fencing. One of the younger kids
  asked me if I knew my nails were black - I said I had shut all 10 of them in
  a car door accidentally. Another, older one, 16 or so asked 'if I was a tranny
  now' - a comment which clearly shows how far my local community, if not many
  wider communities, have to go.
</p>
<p>
  It was a great icebreaker though - random girls in bars would compliment me on
  them, and sometimes we'd have a conversation as a result. I'm not used to talking
  to girls I don't know in bars, but apparently it's something that a lot of men
  enjoy. Sometimes it was pretty intimidating, but sometimes I liked it. It was a
  good measure of a person almost immediately - if they thought it was weird or
  felt uncomfortable because of it, I probably didn't want to pursue any further
  interactions with them. If they commented positively on it and were supportive,
  then the opposite was true.
</p>
<p>
  It was a wonderful act of self care too. In his defense, my father <i>was</i>
  right to some extent - at a time when I was exceptionally low, taking time to
  apply the nail polish every week or so felt relaxing. I was doing something for
  myself, to make myself look... perhaps not better, but different, in a way I
  wanted to be. It was beautifully therapeutic, and I loved that aspect of it.
</p>
<p>
  It was precisely that difference that was why I started doing it in the first place,
  and why I enjoyed it so much. In some awful,
  narcisstic, self aggrandizing, self absorbed hyper-bullshit kinda way, I have never
  felt like I belonged in my environment. I have wanted to be different, disdainful
  of the people I encountered every day, but I have always felt a strong compulsion
  to look and act the same way as them. This was my small, silent first step towards
  rebellion. Men around here don't paint their nails - but I do. I am not like the
  swathes of complacent, narrow-minded accountants that surround me. I was determined
  to do something to change my place in our micro-society, to affirm to myself
  and everyone else that I am <strong>not one of them.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  I sound almost comically like Holden Caulfield. Perhaps, in consideration of the
  ideas above, Caulfield is not quite as insufferable as I had considered him to
  be on first read.
</p>
<p>
  The point is, I miss painting my nails. I stopped because of my job, and I thought
  it could be weird or awkward, or that I might be treated differently because of it.
  I want to start again, but I'm too afraid to do so. I wish I wasn't.
