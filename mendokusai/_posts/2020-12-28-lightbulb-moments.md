The best bit about learning anything, at least in my opinion, is the lightbulb moments you get along the way. After some amount of time struggling with a concept, trying desperately to
make it sink in and feel intuitive, eventually something just clicks, the cartoonish bulb above your head illuminates, and you've got it. That feeling is one of the reasons why I enjoy
programming, and it's made learning a new language especially fun recently; rather than having to wait weeks or months in between eureka moments with a language I'm already fairly
well-versed in, now I can have multiple epiphanies on the inner workings of a language per day.

I know that feeling won't last long, so I'm trying to make the most of it while I can.
