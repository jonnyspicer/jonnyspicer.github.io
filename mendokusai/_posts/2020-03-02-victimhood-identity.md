Recently I have got to know a certain [almost smart](/mendokusai/2020/01/30/almost-smart) individual even
better, and one of the things that they fail to be self aware about is how much of their identity
is built upon the notion that they are inherently a victim. Seeing it in another person was
incredibly jarring, and made me desperate to ensure that I don't allow myself to fall into the
same trip (or at the very least - to not do so outwardly). 

The problem though is that sometimes I still need to talk about Bad Stuff - man feelings, etc -
but with a focus on doing so constructively and without self pity, I've suddenly found my
previously flourishing lexicon to have been diminished significantly. So, today begins a new
journey to learn a language to talk about such things again.
