Yesterday I wrote that I was really excited about Cyberpunk coming out today, as if that was my predominant feeling throughout the day. This wasn't the case at all, as I spent most
of the day being super anxious, just not about something I wanted to write about here, so I wrote something that I feel now is disingenuous. It's something that I have been critical
of other people for doing in the past, and is one of my largest criticisms of social media, so I really ought to know better.

Anyway, the bad thing from yesterday is gone, so now I actually *do* feel excited to play Cyberpunk.
