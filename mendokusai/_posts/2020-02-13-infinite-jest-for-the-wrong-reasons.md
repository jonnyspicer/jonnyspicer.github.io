Today I began [my new year's reading resolution](/mendokusai/2020/01/26/can-jonny-actually-read-challenge-20) and cracked open Infinite Jest on my kindle. The edition I'm reading, rather hilariously, begins with a foreword which attempts to allay any fears the reader might have about
the levels of complexity and subsequent inpenetrability of the novel - which ironically only served to heighten my own. Nonetheless, it added to the sense that I am setting off on a spiritual
and emotionally journey, one from which I will return a changed man, hopefully for the better.

With that being said, I suspect I am not reading the book for the right reasons. I am one of those
problematic people who cannot help but romanticise the tortured artist clich√©, perhaps narcissistically feeling some kind of kinship with those sorts, and in my naive attempts to be self aware about this, posed the question to myself whether or not I would be reading the book had its author, David Foster Wallace, not taken his own life in 2008? The answer, unfortunately, is that I probably would not be. Similarly, I worry I am not reading Infinite Jest in order to read Infinite Jest, and that I am in fact reading Infinite Jest to *have read* Infinite, a goal that while on the face of may seem noble, I expect has a very high chance to bring disappointment.

Despite this, perhaps it is irrelevant whether or not intentions are noble, if the outcome of the
actions they inspire is positive. Even if I am not choosing to begin reading the book for the
right reasons, I suspect that they will be the only things that keep me reading it, as I navigate its 1079 pages of footnotes, satire and post-post-modernism. Perhaps, as they say, the end will justify the means.
