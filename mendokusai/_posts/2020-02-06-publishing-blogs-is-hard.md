title: Publishing blogs is hard
tags: [ Software Engineering ]

Perhaps this post should be entitled "leaving a job half done". I have good very good at *writing* a blog post every day, however it seems I am struggling to successfully
publish them, despite having a python script that theoretically handles the whole thing for me. The problem is of course that I have done half a job writing it, and that it
sort of does what I want, but the test is half written, and it has been left in a "good enough" state that frankly isn't good enough, and it has already cost me 1 ETH, coming
dangerously close to costing me a second today.

The good news is that I am going to spend my weekend writing it properly, and making sure I have a proper pipeline and alerting system too. Sorry Ted ðŸ˜„.
