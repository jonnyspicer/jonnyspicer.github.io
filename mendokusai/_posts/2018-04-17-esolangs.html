<span >Today I went a good way down the esoteric programming language rabbit hole. I really admire people who work towards goals that serve no function or purpose other than to be able to say "I did it", which is pretty much exactly what esolangs are. I've added the making of one to my future projects list, but I'm going to have to learn how to make a compiler first, likely in C, so that's going to take a tonne of learning. Wish me luck.</span>
