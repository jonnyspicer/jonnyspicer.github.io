Lockdown has so far brought with it a lot more sitting in a desk chair, which has sadly also brought with it some lower back pain. As I'm currently on course to have gone the whole
month of January without drinking, I thought I'd set myself a different challenge for the whole of February; rather than give something up every day, take something up every day. As
the title of this post says, that thing is yoga, which I'm hoping will alleviate some of the discomfort I feel, as well as bring me some inner peace to aid in getting through being
stuck in the house all day.

I've tried yoga a smidge before, but am by all accounts a complete novice, so I'm planning on simply following up with Youtube videos every day. Perhaps by March I'll be one step
closer to my spiritual awakening.
