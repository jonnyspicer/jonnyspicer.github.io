In lieu of anything more interesting to write about - this week the marathon I had originally signed up for in October last year got postponed for the second time. It's now been
pushed back until May 2021, which is a long time to wait for a goal that I had planned to already have it. In its stead, I've now signed up for a local marathon in October, as well
as a repeat of the half I did last year for September. It's still kinda amazing to me that I am entering these races - doubly so that in my mind the half is a mere training run for the
full - of course I hope I don't come across as too arrogant. For the vast majority of my life, I never thought I would be able to run a marathon, and now it seems within my grasp,
albeit in the knowledge that it's still going to bee exceptionally painful.

Anyway. I've got some new running shoes. My shin splints feel close to being healed. I have some great targets to aim for. The weather is good. I still feel like running is not an
activity to be enjoyed, and instead more a necessary evil - but at least it's an evil that I might now enact in style.
