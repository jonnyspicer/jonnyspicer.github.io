  I have had a pretty ambivalent relationship with my phone for quite
  a while now. On one hand, all of us would struggle to forgo
  one altogether, given it is now a primary driver in almost all of
  our social and professional lives. Having the seemingly infinite
  wealth of human knowledge at my fingertips seems invaluable a lot of
  the time, especially when I'm trying to impress at dinner parties.
</p>
<p>
  That was a joke. Obviously I don't get invited to parties, dinner
  or otherwise.
</p>

  The point remains though - it is not exactly a hot take to suggest
  we are "enslaved" to our phones, or some other suitably sensational
  choice of phrase. I spend a decent amount of time on my phone, and
  quite a lot of that time I suspect does not really benefit me, often
  making me experience things negatively, eg the increasing-less-mild sense
  of nihilism I have whenever I read the news. So overall is my phone
  +EV for me, I should I, ever the contrarian-wannabe-hipster-douchebag,
  stop using me phone (and then immediately proceed to brag about it to everyone
  who'll listen)?

  No. I am trying not to be "that guy", and just admitting that I am
  millenial trash and that my iPhone dictates my life at this point.
  In the unending and naive quest to improve my life though, I discovered
  <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/beautility-my-ultimate-iphone-setup-1b3dd0c588a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  this</a>, a simple post with a few relatively straightforward ideas to
  change one's iOS habits, with big promises about how it would impact
  my use of the device. I set everything up tonight and it was about as
  easy as advertised - only 15 minutes or so in total. So far I am
  enjoying the new layout a lot more than the old one, although of course
  it is early days yet. Unlocking my phone to see basically nothing is
  a pretty good reminder that I should probably just lock my phone
  again and get on with something.

  I'll report back next weekend with how I feel after a week in this
  new bleak, minimalistic mobile landscape.
