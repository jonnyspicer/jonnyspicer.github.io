Today is day two of my considered effort to choose what to think about. So far, it is proving very difficult to do effectively, but that's what I expected. I promise I am
trying really hard though, still. One thing I noticed today is the disconnect between my feelings and the thoughts that (I think) cause them. If I begin thinking about something
painful, even if I consciously shift to another, completely wholesome thought, the feeling still persists in my body - it sits in my stomach, I feel the unease in my fingertips, the
clouds and fog in front of my eyes and in my mind.

Maybe with practise, I can achieve authority over that part of my psyche too?
