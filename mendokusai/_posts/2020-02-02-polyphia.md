Today I booked tickets and flights to Birmingham to go see arguably the hottest prog metal band out there right now, Polyphia. I've also managed to schedule in a home game,
an ale festival, and potentially another tattoo appointment into just 3 days, and now I am incredibly excited!

Spending money on these kinds of experiences has slowly become more and more of a no-brainer to me. Everything else seems completely pointless where I to choose to continue to
hoard it away, like Smaug on my pile of gold. Do you not think being a dragon under a mountain was an awfully lonely pursuit? I bet all he really wanted was someone to talk to.
