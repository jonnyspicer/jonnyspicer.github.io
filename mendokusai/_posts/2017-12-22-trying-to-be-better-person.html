<span >The goal of trying to be a "better" person is unhelpful vague, painful unoriginal, and frankly only becoming of someone with neither intelligence nor ambition. And so, it is perfectly suited to being my goal.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I'm 50% joking. It is an alarmingly obvious goal to have, but I am an alarmingly dumb person so I think it will be useful to have it in the forefront of my mind. As you can probably tell, it is a goal I am more resigned to than excited about. I am splitting my pursuit of "betterness" into 5 areas: mental health, physical health, work, hobbies and social life. Updates in the future, maybe.&nbsp;</span>
