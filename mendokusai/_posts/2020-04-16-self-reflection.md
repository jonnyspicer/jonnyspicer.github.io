Whenever I hear the words self-reflection, I tend to think of meditation, of sitting quietly by oneself with as few
stimuli as possible, so that you can peel back the shy layers of your consciousness to unearth secrets which you keep
from even yourself. I conjure up an experience largely akin to that of being in the float tank, wherein one is simply
confronted with oneself due to absence of anything else.

A lot of people have talked about quarantine being a time for self-reflection, and it has occured to me that there is
another type of self-reflection that does not come from sitting cross legged and channeling one's kundalini energy,
instead it is altogether more violent. Our psychogenic layers can be stripped away in moments of extreme emotion, not
just in its absence, and in moments of great, sadness and anger, we can glean insights into our true nature. Perhaps
these insights are easier to lose given that we are not purposely looking for them as in the more peaceful approach,
but I think they are just as important nonetheless.

There is no prize for guessing which type of self-reflection I am experiencing a lot of at the moment...
