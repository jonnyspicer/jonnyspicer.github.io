<span >Brood War is nuts to me. A game that is going to be 20 years old next year, still has a wide playerbase both at a professional and casual level, is widely regarded as one of the best games ever created. It's still hugely entertaining to watch and there are legends of the game that have been at top level for almost a decade now, and it's history is rich and exciting. Without Brood War esports would definitely not be where it is today, and the fact it's popularity is so persistent is a testament to it's unique genius.&nbsp;</span>
