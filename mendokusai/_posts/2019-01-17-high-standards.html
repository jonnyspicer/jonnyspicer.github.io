  Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to write a book. I remember when I was in
  primary school, resolving to pen a story 100 pages long, which at the time
  seemed like a feat that would bring me untold recognition and praise upon its
  completion. Naturally I didn't even come close to finishing it - my lack of
  execution obviously set in early in my life.

  About 15 months ago I first considered writing short stories, as a way to
  express myself and the struggles I was dealing with in a less self-absorbed
  way than chronicling my own experiences factually. Obviously I didn't
  ever get round to doing that either, because I am a perennially weak-willed,
  lazy individual.

  Recently I read a blog post (that I have not been able to rediscover
  in order to link or give credit to, sadly) that pointed out that if you wrote 200
  words a day for a mere 125 days, you would be left with 25,000 words of writing,
  and many would consider that to be approximately one book's-worth. Well, I thought
  to myself, I write approximate 200 words a day, and I have done for the past
  125 days or thereabouts. The issues were that firstly those writings
  were solely non-fictional, and I would have no interest in writing anything
  other than fiction; secondly that they are separate pieces and these incongruent
  and incoherent when viewed together; and thirdly that they are, by and large,
  perfectly fucking awful.

  I doubt there is much I will be able to do about the last one, but with some
  kind of concerted effort, I could surely remedy the former two problems. I
  clearly have it in me to write consistently enough to produce enough words
  to fill a book. Furthermore, when I was creating my <a href="/mendokusai/2018/12/23/reading-list" target="_blank">reading list
  for this year,</a> I tried to fill it with authors who I thought would inspire me,
  and whose influence I might be able to draw upon if and when I tried my own
  hand at writing fiction.

  Talking to an old school friend this week, who is infinitely better read than I,
  I realised another hurdle I would have to jump over. If I tried to write a book,
  I would want it to be of an insanely high standard. I'd want to write like
  Proust or Dostoevsky. I'd want my text to be as deep and nuanced as Infinite Jest.
  I might write 200 words in a day, but I'd spend the next fortnight redrafting them.
  I would reject a million good ideas before finally settling on one, not because
  I was satisfied with it, but because I was frustrated at my own lack of progress.
  My vision of the plot would inevitably change often through the processes of
  planning, drafting and then editing. I would invariably find myself ensnared
  <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/betwixt" target="_blank">betwixt</a>
  a desire to both emulate my literary heroes and also to produce
  something unique and original.
</p>

  Despite all this, perhaps I'll write a book one day. It might be fun, in a
  masochistic kinda way.
