<p>
  Any time I have to focus on my breath I become acutely aware of how just how
  poor my ability to breathe is. It feels like I can never breathe both fully
  and comfortably, something gets stuck past a certain point, but I know my
  lungs are not yet full.

  Breathing is undoubtedly the most important skill one could possess, and given
  I have had so much practice, I am little embarrassed to be underperforming
  to the extent that I am. I suppose I have had a lot of time to reinforce my
  own bad habits, and it probably has something to do with my constant use of
  technology and wholly fractured attention.
</p>
<p>
  It seems naive to suggest that I might make another attempt at having a regular
  meditation practice, but I hope to at least try to get better at breathing,
  and the two are basically the same thing.
