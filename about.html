<p>
    I was born and raised on the beautiful island of Guernsey, and have lived here the majority of my life. My career path thus far has had some thrills and spills, the
    most exciting of which was playing poker full time in 2017. Since then I've finally managed to channel the endless hours I've spent at a computer during my lifetime
    into something positive, and I'm now a C# developer for <a href="https://cortex.gg/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Cortex.</a>
</p>

<p>
    I play chess, enjoy climbing and running, and I'm trying really hard to be one of those people that reads a lot of books so I can seem smart when I go on dates. Fortunately,
    I never go on any dates.

    The ethos of this website was inspired almost entirely by <a href="https://genius.com/436676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    this lyric</a> from Childish Gambino's 2011 debut album, "Camp" (please don't @ me about his song "Fuck Your Blog", can't we all just enjoy the irony together?). 
    Trying na√Øvely to follow in his footsteps, I endeavour to write as honestly I can, in an attempt to offset some of the frustration I feel that so many people present 
    themselves so inauthentically on the internet, and the damage that ultimately causes all of us. I'm quite worried that it'll cost me a job opportunity or two in the future, 
    and if I ever became famous enough to the point where I become eligible for cancellation it is going to be a huge liability, but in the meantime I enjoy the catharsis of screaming
    into the void.

    I get a lot of things wrong, in matters of sentiment, fact and spelling, and if you'd like to chastise me about a particularly egregious instance of this then please email me at
    <a href="mailto:spicerjonny@gmail.com">spicerjonny@gmail.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/jjspicer"

    mean things at me</a>. Alternately I love to hear nice things too, or even perfectly neutral things - feedback is always welcome. I
    currently don't have any capacity for freelance work, however I'd be happy to chat about future opportunities regardless.
</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
