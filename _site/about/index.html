      <h1>About</h1>

<p>I was born and raised on the beautiful island of Guernsey, and have lived here the majority of my life. My career has
    taken some winding and unexpected turns;
    from studying law at university, to sports trading, a slightly more logical transition into full time poker, before
    returning to the real world by becoming a
    software developer.
</p>

<p>I play chess, enjoy climbing and running, and still manage to find time to play an unhealthy amount of videogames.
</p>

<p>The goal of this website is to be a public journal of sorts, and as such was inspired almost entirely by <a
        href="https://genius.com/436676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
        this lyric</a> from Childish Gambino's 2011 debut album, 'Camp'. With all that in mind, I endeavour to write as
    honestly I can, often diarising my
    own mental health struggles, as well as writing about technology, media, social issues, diet and fitness. I write a
    post daily and I love doing so,
    it's been both cathartic and rewarding, and I hope to continue doing it for years to come.</p>

<p>I especially love talking to people about the things I've written there, so if you have anything you'd like to say
    then please shoot me an email at
    <a href="mailto:spicerjonny@gmail.com">spicerjonny@gmail.com</a>.
</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
