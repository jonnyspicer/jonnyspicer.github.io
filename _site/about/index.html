      <h1>About</h1>

<p>
I was born and raised on the island of Guernsey, and have lived here my whole life (although I am hoping that changes in the near future). I was a serial underachiever at school, then a serial underachiever studying law at Lancaster University, before dropping out to become a serial underachiever in the field of sports trading, which I quit to underachieve at full time online poker, and now I’m a web developer. I haven’t really had enough time in my new profession to underachieve, but don’t worry, I’ll get there.
</p>

<p>
I play chess, sometimes I pretend that I powerlift, and I have a burning passion for   video games. I’m trying to build some cool stuff with code too.
</p>

<p>
<s>The goal of this website is to capture some of my thoughts and feelings as I try to figure out whether it’s possible to live the dream and do what I love for a living, or if I will eventually have to resign myself to being an accountant.

The goal of this website is to capture some of my thoughts and feelings as I accept that it is not possible for me to live the dream and do what I love for a living, and desperately still try to avoid becoming an accountant.
