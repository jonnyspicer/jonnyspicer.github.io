When I was younger I had nightmares a lot, and I’d try to scream, but no sound would come out. &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is how I feel with emotions. I have them, and I want to express them, but I can’t. I don’t know what words to use and who to, what faces to make, to laugh or to cry. It’s frustrating. &lt;/div&gt;" />
