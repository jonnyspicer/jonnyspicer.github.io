<meta name="description" content="Do you know that feeling when you sleep on your hand for a solid 8 hours? You wake up and are completely unable to type in your passcode to get the alarm on your phone to stop, so you are stuck with it’s cacophonous beeping for a minute longer. Or when you have local anaesthetic - perhaps from the dentist. You try to speak after the operation, the words and shapes you must make are familiar, but you still can’t form them. When I was younger I had nightmares a lot, and I’d try to scream, but no sound would come out. &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is how I feel with emotions. I have them, and I want to express them, but I can’t. I don’t know what words to use and who to, what faces to make, to laugh or to cry. It’s frustrating. &lt;/div&gt;" />
