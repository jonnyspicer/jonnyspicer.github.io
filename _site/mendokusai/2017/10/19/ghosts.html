  <span >Having people from my past message me is a weird experience. We are always told to live in the present, eschewing thoughts of the future or dwelling on the past. But when somebody messages you who you haven't spoken to in a long time, along with their simple message comes a torrent of memories and emotions. A lot of them I don't want to experience again. Should I push them back down and try to forget, or should I accept the discomfort now, and try to deal with them? Living in the present is harder than they told me.&nbsp;</span>
