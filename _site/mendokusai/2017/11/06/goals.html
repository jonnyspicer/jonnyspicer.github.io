<meta name="description" content="Goals seem important, although I am not entirely sure. I think they are meant to provide motivation, and a sense of fulfillment once complete. For a long time I have struggled with setting good long term goals, given the unpredictable nature of poker and having no desire to set a results-orientated poker goal. But, after reading this and starting to do the exercises, last night while unable to sleep I think I found my big, overarching goal. It’s quantifiable, has a set date I have to do it by, and it’s going to be a huge challenge. It was the last thing I thought about last night and the first thing I thought about this morning, which seems to be a good sign. I’m excited about accomplishing it. However also in the article above, it says not to share your goals with other people, as that triggers a sense of false satisfaction… so you’ll have to guess. " />
