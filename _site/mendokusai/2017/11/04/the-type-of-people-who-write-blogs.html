  <span >I can't stand people that have blogs, let alone people that have two like me - it's so pretentious. I feel like it implies I think people should care about or be interested in what I write, and that is absolutely not the case. If you are reading this, what are you doing? Stop immediately. Go outside, pick up a hobby, get a girlfriend, do pretty much <i>anything</i>&nbsp;rather than waste your time like this.&nbsp;</span>
