<meta name="description" content="Today I fly home, unsure about my future and whether this “adventure” is over. I, and presumably many others, feel like we should constantly be progressing in life, and we should be making more steps forwards than backwards, but it is not obvious which direction we are heading towards. Today feels like it is definitely a step of some kind, but I have no idea in what direction. When I think about going home, I feel almost every emotion I can think of, sad, happy, scared, excited, regretful, angry (as always). It’s going to be a weird few days I think, but I am hoping one day I will be able to look back at all this and smile.Merry Christmas friends." />
