It’s not going to be easy to change but I think I have to try, if I want to be happy. But I don’t know where to start, I feel like I am searching for some kind of fundamental principle to try and rebuild myself around. I don’t think there are any fundamental principles for life though.The way I am living right now is unsustainable to say the least. Not doing any work, binge drinking and eating pizza and ice cream for every meal. I know it is “bad”, but right now it feels good, and it makes me feel something that at least resembles happiness. Maybe that is a depressing reflection on me. " />
