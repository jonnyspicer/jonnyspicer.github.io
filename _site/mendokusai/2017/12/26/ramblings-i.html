<meta name="description" content="It is 8:45am and I am sat in Wetherspoons in Gatwick airport enjoying a pint of Heineken. I love Spoons, this Heineken tastes great and today I will have a hot shower for the first time in nearly 4 months. My body is confused. I intentionally didn’t sleep much last night (I guess two nights ago now) with the plan to sleep on the plane, which landed in London at 2am Mexican time. I got no sleep whatsoever, and it is now a bright and sunny morning in the UK, so I will not sleep for another 13 or 14 hours most likely. I am also doing my best to poison myself with alcohol as much as possible. As discussed previously, it is poison, but it temporarily medicated my problems.&lt;div&gt;Throughout my journey I have felt fragile, yet full of love. When I checked in at Cancun, my baggage was 2kg overweight, and the lady told me that it would be a fixed charge if $54. I managed to rearrange my bags and got it down to just 1kg over, and she let me off. I felt full of love for her. Then a man in TGI Friday’s poured me an overpriced draught Dos Equis, and I was full of love for him. The immigration officer in Gatwick chuckled at my terrible joke at 7am on a Tuesday, while I felt broken, and I was full of love for him. When I land in Guernsey, my friend will be there to pick me up, and take me to another friends house to spend the night. I am full of love for both of them. Why do I have to be so ground down in order to feel so much love for the people around me?&lt;/div&gt;" />
