  <h1>Liberation</h1>

  <span >I cannot remember even close to the exact quote, but it is something along the lines of "to lose half of one's wealth is tortuous, to lose the entirety is liberating". It seems the same can be said for ego too. When you lose everything you built your own identity on and there is nothing left, one might expect it to be devastating, like an implosion as you ego collapses in on itself. But so far, it feels bizarrely liberating. I am not scared of the future like I was. I simply want to go home, get drunk, and spend time with my friends and people I love. Why did I lose sight of all that?</span>
