<meta name="description" content="I have loved Dungeons and Dragons since I was a small child. One of the first video games I ever remember playing was the original Baldur’s Gate, and it is still one of my favourite games of all time. Today I want to start a new campaign but don’t know which one to choose or what build to go for, and I am grateful to have such a wonderful problem. I feel a little guilty about my love for the genre as I know it is rooted in escapism - I feel that life in Faerûn is better than my own life. But I think the satisfaction that comes from slaying a dragon or an evil archmage will more than compensate for that guilt. " />
