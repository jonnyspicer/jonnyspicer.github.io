<meta name="description" content="I’ve decided to take a little bit (more) of time off from playing poker, but I don’t want to have a complete holiday, I think I would get bored of the beach pretty quickly. So I have been thinking about what I can do with my time and have decided to try and do several 24 hour “challenges” in different things, to see how much I can improve at a skill in just one day. So far my ideas are thus:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write a short story &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write a stand up routine or comedy sketch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start a new speed game from scratch and submit to the speedrun.com leaderboards by the end of the day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get my blitz chess rating up as much as possible, follow a study plan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improve my Spanish in as much as possible, with some kind of tangible goal at the end, either to write a poem in Spanish, translate my short story into Spanish, have some kind of spoken conversation etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Good luck me.&lt;/div&gt;" />
