  <span >The relationship I have with alcohol is strange. I like drinking a lot, but have always felt guilty about it, because it is unhealthy. However, my understanding is that it is one of the most powerful anxiolytic drugs available, so I think it stands to reason that I would benefit from its effects and enjoy consuming it. If it makes me happier, but is has some negative health effects when consistently consumed in moderate-large quantities, is it a net negative on my life? It is hard to tell.&nbsp;</span>
