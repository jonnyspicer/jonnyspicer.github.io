<meta name="description" content="Tomorrow is the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, where Eliud Kipchoge will attempt to be the first person to break the 2 hour marathon barrier, making history in the process and proving that, as he says, no human is limited. The event will be held in Vienna (I am incredibly excited to say that I will be flying there later today to watch), and it seems that Kipchoge and the Ineos team have accounted for every variable they possibly can. Kipchoge is an inspiration, but not just for his athletic prowess, for his humility and sense of appreciation for the simple things in life. He is a multimillionaire, but chooses to maintain the same lifestyle he had growing up in rural Kenya, working on his farm, spending time with his family and sharing toilet-cleaning duties at his training camp with the rest of his team. He knows what makes him happy, and he refuses to be taken in by any of the false promises undoubtedly being made to him as a result of his fame and fortune. I’m jealous of him for that - I hope one day I will live as simply and peacefully as he does, and it will bring me as much joy as it evidently does to him. Naturally, the entire internet is trying to predict whether or not the barrier will actually be broken. I can’t even really comprehend quite how difficult a feat it will be if he manages to do it - it requires him to run 100m in 17 seconds, 422 times consecutively, and I can’t even do it once. With that being said, I believe wholeheartedly he will do it - there is nothing really to suggest that he won’t. I actually think he will smash the 2 hour mark, and take a whole minute off his 2017 attempt in Monza, cruising to victory in 1:59:25 - and I can’t wait to find out tomorrow whether or not I’m right." />

  <p>Tomorrow is the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, where Eliud Kipchoge will attempt to be the first person to break the 2 hour marathon barrier,
making history in the process and proving that, as he says, no human is limited. The event will be held in Vienna (I am
incredibly excited to say that I will be flying there later today to watch), and it seems that Kipchoge and the Ineos team have
accounted for every variable they possibly can.</p>

<p>Kipchoge is an inspiration, but not just for his athletic prowess, for his humility and sense of appreciation for the simple things
in life. He is a multimillionaire, but chooses to maintain the same lifestyle he had growing up in rural Kenya, working on his farm,
spending time with his family and sharing toilet-cleaning duties at his training camp with the rest of his team. He knows what makes
him happy, and he refuses to be taken in by any of the false promises undoubtedly being made to him as a result of his fame and
fortune. I’m jealous of him for that - I hope one day I will live as simply and peacefully as he does, and it will bring me as much
joy as it evidently does to him.</p>

<p>Naturally, the entire internet is trying to predict whether or not the barrier will actually be broken. I can’t even really
comprehend quite how difficult a feat it will be if he manages to do it - it requires him to run 100m in 17 seconds, 422 times
consecutively, and I can’t even do it once. With that being said, I believe wholeheartedly he will do it - there is nothing really
to suggest that he won’t. I actually think he will smash the 2 hour mark, and take a whole minute off his 2017 attempt in Monza,
cruising to victory in 1:59:25 - and I can’t wait to find out tomorrow whether or not I’m right.</p>
