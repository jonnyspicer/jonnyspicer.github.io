  <h1>Alcohol IV</h1>

  <p>
    18 Aug 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>When I have finished the (admittedly rather large) glass of wine on my desk, I will
have drunk my supply of alcohol at home clean, and subsequently plan on giving up alcohol
for the foreseeable future, although unlikely forever. Despite enjoying greatly the conversations and experiences it enables me to have, I am hopeful that it’s mere removal
from my weekly routine will aid weight loss efforts, and there will surely be other health
benefits too.</p>

<p>It is going to make socialising different, and more effort, but perhaps this is not a bad thing. If I have inhibitions about expressing something, I am going to have to overcome
them while stone cold sober. Vulnerability and radical honesty are the orders of the day,
and now it’s time to get better at making them a habit, rather than just something after a 
few drinks.</p>
