  <h1>The End of Summer</h1>

  <p>
    27 Aug 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>This morning I got up at 5:35am, to discover it was still dark outside. It was the first time it’d been black outside my window upon
waking in months, and I was hit by a sudden pang of <a href="https://polly.gg/2019/08/26/new-year-new-me">post-season melancholy</a> - the
summer is over, for another year.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I am sad is because it’s been quite the summer for me, possibly the best of the past decade. I can’t remember a
year where I spent so much of it outside in the sun, spent so much time with my friends, or went swimming in the sea so often. I even
have a bit of a tan, which is practically unheard of.</p>

<p>I changed a lot as a person over the summer too. My confidence and self-esteem have grown to the point where I borderline love myself. I don’t hate having photos taken of me anymore (not as much at least). I feel more comfortable carrying a conversation,
being myself, and looking in the mirror. It’s pretty neat. So maybe I do not need to reinvent myself in time for academic new year -
I am pretty happy with where I am. I don’t need to set too many lofty goals or high expectations for the near future, and just enjoy
things as they are.</p>
