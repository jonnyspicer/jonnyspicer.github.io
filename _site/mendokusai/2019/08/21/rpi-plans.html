  <p>As much as I loathe the Internet of Things, raspberry pis are pretty neat, so I have dutifully ordered one of the new model 4s. I have some pretty exciting plans for it, including but not limited to;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting it up as a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">pi-hole</a>;</li>
  <li>Setting up <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a>;</li>
  <li>Configuring it to allow my PC to wake-on-LAN, so I can power on and then remote into that machine via the Pi over the internet;</li>
  <li>Running a cron to check the status of this website;</li>
  <li>Configuring a cron that can send automated tweets on my behalf and hopefully do something funky and interesting, very much inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAOOdYsK7MM">Hunter Scott’s DefCon talk</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll open source any of the code that I end up writing, and probably do a write up of any progress I make/challenges I face here. Wish me luck!</p>
