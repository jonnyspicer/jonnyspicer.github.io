  <p>I have been a stereotypical nerd my whole life, an indoorsman, possessing all the lamest of vampiric qualities without any of the sexy ones. But between 
starting to run, and having an office with a view of the sea, and I am coming around to the idea that I’ve not been living the optimal lifestyle. 
Guernsey is so beautiful - the cliffs, the bays, the ocean. It all does an infinitely better job of putting life in perspective than staring at 
my monitor does.</p>
