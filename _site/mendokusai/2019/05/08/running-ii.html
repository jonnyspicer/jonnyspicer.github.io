  <h1>Running II</h1>

  </p>

  <p>After covering 17km in 3 days, surely a massive personal best for me, my body <em>hurts</em>. My calves are aching and tight, and my 
feet have been pummeled, my arches ache even to walk and my blisters are truly vile. Today I took the day off, and I will likely 
take the next two days off as well, getting injured right at the start of my illustrious racing career seems unwise.</p>

<p>Still, I hope this necessary R&amp;R time doesn’t cause my newfound enthusiasm to wane. If the calorie counter on Strava is to be even 
vaguely believed, running could be the final piece of the e’er-mysterious weight loss puzzle. As much as it pains me to say it, 
running is kind of great - it gets you out of the house, you get fitter and healthier, you get to feel better about yourself, it 
can have a certain meditative quality - I already feel like I have learned a lot about myself during the tail end of some of routes.</p>

<p>And also there’s a certain someone that I have to annihilate at park run in June.</p>
