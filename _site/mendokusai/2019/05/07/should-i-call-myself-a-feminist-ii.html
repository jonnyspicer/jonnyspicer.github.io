  <p>Yesterday I may have inadvertently outed myself as a bit of a basement dweller. If any of my opinion around feminism is informed 
by consuming whatever I read on Reddit, I ought to re-evaluate.  I’ve seen it hypothesized that 1% of Redditors generate 99% of 
comments and posts, and intuitively I believe it - clearly that kind of system is not going to foster a healthy environment for 
discussion. It’s also a conversation in which I participate in very passively - I’ve only commented on anything across the entirety 
of Reddit in the last year, once to get a beta invite for <a href="https://tildes.net/">Tildes</a> and once to troll my roommate (about something 
other than gender).</p>

<p>Criticism has also been levied against me that I did not in fact answer the question of whether or not I should call myself a feminist, 
which I think is valid. My is that yes, I probably <em>should</em> call myself a feminist, but am still too much of a pussy to do so.</p>

<p>I’d feel somewhat upset with myself to end on that note though, we need a hopeful sign off that leaves you feeling like there is the 
possibility of a brighter future for all of us, and lets me sleep wholly guilt free tonight. So, my promise is thus: I’ll try to 
talk to more people AFK about feminism, and overhaul my views to be in line with how I feel after those conversations.</p>
