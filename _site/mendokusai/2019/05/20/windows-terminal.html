  <h1>Windows Terminal</h1>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal">Windows Terminal</a> is on the way and I am very excited for it, because that means 
there will <em>finally</em> be a CLI I can use on Windows which has tabs… seriously, how did it take so long?! For me, PowerShell 
has always paled in comparison to both iTerm2 and guake which I use on other systems, in terms of flexibility and functionality 
as well as the whole tab shebang. Not only that, but being able to seemlessly add WSL tabs where I can script in bash and actually 
know the commands will be a godsent, rather than having to do the weird mish-mash of dotnet commands in PowerShell and then do 
everything else in my Ubuntu shell like I’m currently doing, which is a nightmare.</p>

<p>Given my currently massive preference for VSCode over competing editors, if Terminal is everything it promises to be then I think I might 
be back on the Microsoft development hype train.</p>
