  <p>Whenever I have tried to articulate how I feel during a period of mental struggle in the past, I have often said that I am overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by obligations, 
expectations, calendars and to-do lists, social calls to be made and blog posts to be written. At some point it all gets too much, and rather than face any of it, 
I shy away from everything and confine myself to my bed, paralysed by the fear that I won’t get everything I need to done, and so ironically doing nothing.</p>

<p>The idea is of course that that was then, and this is now, and so I am better equiped to deal with those feelings before they become insurmountable. This week I can 
see them creeping up - I am pushing myself to do well in my new job, have been trying to hold conversations with many friends, plan trips, court my wife-to-be 
on Tinder, run, not eat total shit, troubleshoot various tech problems, and finally make some long overdue updates to this site.
Somewhere in all of that, I need to find time to stop, breath, and look after myself. To remember what makes me happy, to reevaluate and reprioritise accordingly.
To watch Netflix and eat ice cream.</p>

<p>It’s odd, to feel myself slipping, but even armed with that knowledge not to be sure how to catch myself. Being aware of it seems like a good start, trying 
consciously to put less pressure on myself in all the areas described above, trying to value time spent looking after myself more.</p>
