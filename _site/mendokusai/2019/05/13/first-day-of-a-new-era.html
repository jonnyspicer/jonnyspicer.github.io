<meta name="description" content="As one epoch comes to an end, so must a new one begin, which is precisely the case for my career as I began a new job today. My job title has contracted down to a worryingly vague ‘developer’, but I now share that with every single one of my colleagues, and it is nice to feel equal in title if not in knowledge or ability. I certainly do not feel equal in either of those two things, but that is immensely refreshing - being acutely aware of my own lack of understanding of a new tech stack has filled me with a rejuvenated sense of excitement. I am looking forward to the new challenges and new opportunities that come along with new employment. Hopefully this will be my era of Reiwa as well." />

  <h1>First Day of a New Era</h1>

    13 May 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>As one epoch comes to an end, so must a new one begin, which is precisely the case for my career as I began a new job today. 
My job title has contracted down to a worryingly vague ‘developer’, but I now share that with every single one of my colleagues, 
and it is nice to feel equal in title if not in knowledge or ability. I certainly do not feel equal in either of those two things, 
but that is immensely refreshing - being acutely aware of my own lack of understanding of a new tech stack has filled me with a 
rejuvenated sense of excitement.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to the new challenges and new opportunities that come along with new employment. Hopefully this will be my era
of Reiwa as well.</p>
