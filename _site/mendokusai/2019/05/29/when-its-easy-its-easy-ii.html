  <h1>When it's easy, it's easy II</h1>

  <p>

  <p>Four and a half months later, and I’ve not yet sunk back into the abyssal clutch of depression. Neat.</p>

<p>Recently, things have been especially good, and as a result, things are still easy. It’s easy to get 
up at 6am and go running, to track my calories, to make social arrangements - even ones I would once 
have had crippling anxiety over. In a way it’s less easy to write these posts, because I think they 
were more interesting when I was unhappy - but that’s a good problem to have.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I’ve laid enough groundwork to ingrain any of these changes should things so south 
again, perhaps it’ll all go to shit. I’m relatively confident my diet won’t, as I’ve been meal 
prepping for a few months now, but running is a new infatuation, and social withdrawal is always 
easy to slip back into regardless of how well-practised in maintaining dialogue with my friends 
I might feel.</p>

<p>On the other hand… Perhaps this time I won’t fall back into the deep dark well. If I remain 
in good spirits, I feel like I could finally tackle my weight loss demons without rampant 
comfort eating disrupting the battle. Maybe I could stop pitying myself for long enough to 
go out and find a girlfriend, and get her to pity me instead. Maybe I’ll actually 
figure out what I want to do with my life - who knows? The possibilities are endless.</p>
