<p>Today I want to pay homage to what is comfortably the best fast food place in Guernsey. It is of course, (the) Love Shack, situated 
near the bottom of St Julian’s Avenue, and it is a 2am institution. While it’s primary fare may be kebabs, it does not deserve the low 
reputation associated with many establishments of its ilk, as the food is consistently delicious, and while not exactly being healthy, 
it is far from the greasy, oily late-night feast that one might usually expect to find after getting kicked out of the club. I think 
that the best possible endorsement I can give is that Sam and I periodically visit the Shack for dinner when we are <em>stone cold sober</em>, 
on a weeknight no less. The Shack is always open, seemingly neverendlingly staffed by its proprietor, whose name regretfully I do not know, 
but who I have infinite respect for, for his hardwork, level of customer service and dedication to his craft.</p>

<p>God bless Love Shack.</p>
