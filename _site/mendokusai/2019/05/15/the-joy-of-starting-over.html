  <p>Starting from an entirely new tech stack this week has been challenging for reasons both numerous and obvious, but thusfar I am 
relishing the opportunity. Switching from *nix-like to Windows, PHP to C#, functional to object-oriented, AWS to Azure, jQuery to 
React, etc etc, all require adaptation and a huge volume of learning in order to be able to contribute meaningfully to new projects.
With that being said, one of my commits got merged into the master branch on day two of my new position, which I think deserves at 
least a tepid round of applause.</p>

<p>The enormity of unacquired knowledge being dangled in front of me has left me feeling enthused about learning, and eager to catch up 
with my colleagues, and the fact that I get to write interesting programmes during the process is the cherry on the cake. Now if you’ll 
excuse me, I have to spend the rest of my evening figuring out how the fuck MVC works.</p>
