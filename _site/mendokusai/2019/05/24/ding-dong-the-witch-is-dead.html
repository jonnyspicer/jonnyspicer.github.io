  <h1>Ding Dong The Witch is Dead</h1>

  <p>This is, I believe, my first blog on the subject of politics, a subject that I have by and large deliberately avoided writing about. In part because I don’t think anyone 
should care about my political opinions, given my total lack of research or comprehension of any of the issues involved, and also in part because political discourse on 
the internet is, for lack of a better phrase, a total shitshow and I have no desire to contribute to that. I have always labelled myself as apathetic to the subject at 
large, believing that in the end, which particular posh wanker gets elected won’t actually produce a meaningful effect on my life, however Brexit changed all that, when 
I realised the rubbernecking opportunity to end them all, the chance to watch an entire country’s political system derail, crash, explode and then scatter debris, up close 
over the course of three years (and counting of course). It’s been compelling viewing to say the least.</p>

<p>Today the train conductor has flung herself from the lead carriage, with Mrs May announcing her imminent resignation, and despite using that particular metaphor, I am in 
fact rather sad to see her go. Ignoring the fact that all of her likely successors are inevitably self-serving, career driven xenophobes, and that I have disagreed with 
her decisions at many points in the Brexit process, I have come to admire her a great deal, even more so as a result of her speech today. I truly cannot think of any job 
I would have wanted less than to be Prime Minister over the past three years - Mrs May’s task was to unite a country that has never been more divided in living memory, 
preserve democracy, strengthen an unstable economy, and restore faith in not just her government, but indeed the entire political system. I cannot even begin to imagine 
the strains and the pressures that she must have felt as she tried to accomplish this insurmountable task while beseiged on all sides, yet at all times she remained 
resolute, dignified and remained true to what she believed in, truly acting as a servant to her country, in the way that she believed was best. It was only today 
that she finally cracked and displayed emotion publically, a reminder to the nation that she is as human as any of us, serving to really emphasise her resilience during 
her time as leader.</p>

<p>I am sure plenty of people will not be writing nice things about Mrs May this evening, but I for one have been inspired by her.</p>
