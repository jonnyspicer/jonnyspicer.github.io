  Dear Ted,
</p>
<p>
  When I posted the oldest blog I could find of yours for April Fool's Day, I was
  of course trying to wind you up a little, although I hope you don't think that
  I was mocking you or the post, because actually I love it. Posts like this
  are exactly the reason we made that bet in the first place, and even if you
  may have cringed a little rereading it (I'm happy to report your spelling has
  improved significantly in the past 8.5 years), I hope you enjoy it at least
  some fraction of the amount I do.
</p>
<p>
  It's candid and vulnerable and even if it might not be the most prosaic thing
  in the entire world, I wish more people communicated like this. It shows
  what's changed over time, something which is easily forgotten, and probably
  kept you at least a little accountable along the way. I'd love to read an
  updated version of it, and I hope I enjoy reading my old posts in the future
  as much as I enjoyed this one of yours.
</p>
