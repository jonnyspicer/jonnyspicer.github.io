  <h1>The Adventure is Almost Over</h1>

  </p>

  <p>Today is our last full day in New York, as we’ll be boarding the plane back to
London evening. I knew that spending so long away from home and my comfort zone
would be difficult for me, that I’d get anxious, and I had expected to be desperate
to come back by this point, but in actuality, I’m really not.</p>

<p>Of course, on one hand those things are true - I have at times been very anxious,
I am excited for my own bed, for things to not be so damn expensive anymore and
to see my roommate again. But this trip has been everything I’d hoped for and
more, I can’t remember the last time I was this happy for this long, here I’ve
been able to spend my time with incredible, inspirational people and have
forged or strengthened my relationships with them.</p>

<p>It’s been an emotional couple of weeks but ultimately I feel happier about myself
and life in general as a result. I know I will take all that home with me, as well
as the amazing memories I’ve made, but it still makes me a little sad that it all
has to come to an end.</p>
