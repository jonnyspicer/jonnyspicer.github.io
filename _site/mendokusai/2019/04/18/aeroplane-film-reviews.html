  <p>As I am currently stuck in Gatwick Airport unable to even check in for another three
hours, I thought it would be a good time to review some of the films that I watched
on the plane to and from the Big Apple.</p>

<h3 id="the-green-book">The Green Book</h3>

<p>First up was the somewhat controversial The Green Book, starring Viggo Mortensen
and Marshala Ali. I can understand somewhat why some people felt this film was
problematic - given that it deals directly with racial issues in the American south,
it is a very ‘white’ film, and Mortensen’s character is very much the protagonist,
whereas perhaps the film would’ve been better served by making Ali’s character
the central one. Despite these reservations, I still found the film powerful and
uplifting, a testament to the fact that human experience transcends race as well
as a reminder that we must all be compassionate to one another if we are going to
find solutions to society’s problems. Imperfect, but in my opinion still worthy of
the acclaim it received - well worth a watch if you need a little faith in humanity
restoring.</p>

<h3 id="the-darjeeling-limited">The Darjeeling Limited</h3>

<p>After thoroughly enjoying Moonrise Kingdom recently, I was more than happy to dive
into another Wes Andersen film when the opportunity presented itself. As with all
his films it would seem, The Darjeeling Limited is stunningly shot and a wonderful
piece of artistic cinema, although if I remember correctly at no point does Owen
Wilson say the word ‘wow’ which is, frankly, unforgivable. The main appeal is
the aesthetics rather than the plot, but I enjoy stories that need a lot of
interpretation anyway, so in turn I enjoyed the film. Good if you want to watch
something gorgeous, bad if you want to be on the edge of your seat.</p>

<h3 id="three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri">Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</h3>

<p>This was comfortably my favourite plane film from this trip. It hits like a truck</p>
<ul>
  <li>be prepared to feel emotions in a far more complicated way than you have before.
Poignant, brutal and agonizing, every time you think things can’t get any worse,
they do. Compelling from start to finish with an incredible storyline and amazing
acting performances, the film still has an uplifting side even in the face of the
starkest possible situations. It encapsulates the full range of human emotions,
from unthinkable anger and unspeakable violence, to tear-jerking love and compassion.
A must-watch, but not when you’re feeling fragile.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-revenant">The Revenant</h3>

<p>The movie that finaly netted my boy Leo the Oscar, but in all honestly, I don’t
entirely see why. The plot can essentially be summed up as “Leonardo Di Caprio
crawls through the forest for three hours, groaning and writhing in pain, and eats
large quantities of raw meat. Also sleeps inside a horse.” Aaaand that’s basically
it - he barely even has any dialogue. The film was fine, but I can’t say it did
it for me, I think it was a little overrated. Sorry Leo.</p>
