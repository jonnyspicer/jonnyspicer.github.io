  <p><em>Desert Island Discs</em> was recently voted the greatest radio show of all time, and
so to celebrate I thought I would post my own choices, despite the fact that
almost certainly nobody cares.</p>

<p>For any readers who aren’t familiar with the Radio 4 show, each ‘castaway’ is marooned
on a desert island, and permitted to only take 8 records, one book (in addition
to the complete works of Shakespeare and the Bible) and ony luxury item which cannot
be used to aid their escape or allow them any kind of communication with the outside world.
The idea is that the songs and items chosen will allow the guest to tell their
story, however naturally I don’t have any interesting story, so the choices below
don’t really have a coherent message.</p>
