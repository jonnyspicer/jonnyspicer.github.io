  <p>
  I've now spent roughly one whole day in the land of the free (not as in beer).
  My impressions so far are largely that everything is just much bigger here...
  the cars, the coffee cups, the government public debt. I'm pretty sure I even saw
  the biggest flag I've ever seen yesterday, proudly flying high above the
  idyllic Port Jefferson. The people have been very friendly so far, and nobody
  has interrogated me about my English accent either.
</p>
<p>
  This morning we are embarking on one of what I hope will be many authentic American
  experiences - the diner breakfast. I've been told that essentially everything
  on the menu is excellent and so I am sure I will inevitably be transfixed
  by the paralysis that comes with excessive choice, but hopefully the bottomless
  coffee will be enough to snap me out of it and see me through.
</p>
<p>
  And then this afternoon, we will be moving on to the main event for the day -
  several wine tastings at several vineyards. As far as I can tell, binge
  drinking culture is far less ingrained in the average American psyche - perhaps
  I will be able to show them the light?
