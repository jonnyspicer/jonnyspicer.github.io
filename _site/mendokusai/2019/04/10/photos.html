  <p>I never really take photos of anything. My rationale for this is that I am worried
that it will detract from my presence in the moment, and that I won’t appreciate
what I am actually experiencing - instead I will be focused too hard on getting
the perfect snap. But now I am wondering whether I should reconsider my stance.</p>

<p>On this trip there have been some great photos, and in some I am genuinely
smiling and laughing. Having a picture, a crystallised version of that instant,
means that I can look back and relive it, and enjoy some lesser version of that
feeling again. If I write a blog every day to archive my thoughts, should I not
do the same with pictures?</p>
