  I am going to get to under 83kg if it is the last thing I do. Well, not quite,
  because I am similarly determined to achieve my goal through healthy means,
  so ideally it will not even be close to the last thing I do, but you know
  what I mean.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever I write one of these posts, I am acutely aware of how many predecessors
  they have, in both blog and oral form. I must sound deluded at this point,
  long past the point of naivete. The question is, as always, what am I going to
  do differently? I am still convinced that if I try enough strategies, one will
  eventually work for me.

  There are a couple of answers this time. The first two are relatively small
  and easy - to try to meal prep larger portions (so less potential to snack/binge
  outside of these) and to try to apply <a href="https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  second-order thinking</a> to the problems of dieting. The biggest change,
  undoubtedly the most difficult to enact but equally the most likely to produce
  meaningful results, is to better handle the emotions that cause my frequent
  bouts of comfort eating, which for the past few months has been stress. My
  specific stress-reduction plan will have to wait for another day though, as I have
  a plane to catch!
