  Today a new adventure begins, and I couldn't be more excited. This time tomorrow
  I'll be in Heathrow airport, eagerly waiting to board a flight to JFK airport
  and explore New York, one of the greatest cities in the world (allegedly). It
  will be my second trip there, but I undertook the first when I was 3 years old,
  so that doesn't really count. I'm going to subside solely on pizza, cheesecake,
  and shitty American piss-beer, and my goal is to perfect my caricaturish Yank
  accent.
</p>
<p>
  Bizarrely, I have much less anxiety about the journey now then I did a couple
  of weeks ago - my worries of being depressed and bringing my fellow travelers
  down have evaporated, and now I suspect the opposite is going to be true.
  I am ready to be inspired by the places and people around me, and I think
  it has potential to be a transformative experience - at this point I can't
  wait to get on the plane.
