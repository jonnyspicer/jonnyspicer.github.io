  <h1>Just Enjoy It, You Fucking Idiot</h1>

  <p>Not to brag, but things are going great for me right now. My career is on the up,
my social life is improving, I have a tan (by my standards at least) and my
self-esteem is slowly climbing out of the dumpster. Honestly, I’m borderline
running out of things to complain about on this blog, so much so I’m worried I
wouldn’t be able to maintain my daily posting routine.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean there’s quite <em>nothing</em> to complain about though. Amidst all
this happiness, part of me is trying very hard not to be happy - to overthink
thanks, to catastrophise and self-sabotage. The more things in my life improve,
the stronger the urge to resist happiness becomes, but I refuse to give in to it.</p>

<p>Jonny, just enjoy it, you fucking idiot.</p>
