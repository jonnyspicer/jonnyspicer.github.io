<meta name="description" content="Firstly, a disclaimer: this is without doubt the most intoxicated I have been while attempting to write one of these posts. It took me four tries to correctly enter my password. Please submit pull requests/issues with any typos, grammar mistakes or grossly offensive language. Today I experienced (again), one of the most emotional moments in my recent uptick in mood - my friends commenting that I seemed happier. In fact, while saying goodbye to the friend I had come to New York to see, she commented that she was happy that I was happy. This was echoed by my travelling companion who made me burst into tears not long after, by confronting me with the grim reality that people actually care about me. As much as I have put in every ounce of effort in an incredibly selfish way, putting myself as the primary focus, I have many friends who stood by me while I was struggling for an exceptionally long time, and who wanted me to get better, often more than I myself did. So, it feels good to be happy, not just for selfish reasons, but because I can finally share my happiness with those around me, and they can finally be exposed to what they saw in me all along. Thank you, to everyone reading this, for being part of the journey." />
