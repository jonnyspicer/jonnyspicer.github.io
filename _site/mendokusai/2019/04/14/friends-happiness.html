  <h1>Friends' Happiness</h1>

  <p>
    14 Apr 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>Firstly, a disclaimer: this is without doubt the most intoxicated I have been while
attempting to write one of these posts. It took me four tries to correctly enter
my password. Please submit pull requests/issues with any typos, grammar mistakes or
grossly offensive language.</p>

<p>Today I experienced (again), one of the most emotional moments in my recent uptick
in mood - my friends commenting that I seemed happier. In fact, while saying goodbye
to the friend I had come to New York to see, she commented that she was happy that
I was happy. This was echoed by my travelling companion who made me burst into
tears not long after, by confronting me with the grim reality that people actually
care about me. As much as I have put in every ounce of effort in an incredibly
selfish way, putting myself as the primary focus, I have many friends who stood
by me while I was struggling for an exceptionally long time, and who wanted me to
get better, often more than I myself did. So, it feels good to be happy, not just
for selfish reasons, but because I can finally share my happiness with those around me,
and they can finally be exposed to what they saw in me all along. Thank you, to everyone
reading this, for being part of the journey.</p>
