  <h1>Expectations Revisited</h1>

  <p>I am a big believe in the idea that <a href="https://www.solveforhappy.com">one’s happiness is the difference between one’s expectations and one’s reality</a>.
I’ve also <a href="/mendokusai/2018/11/03/i-expect-myself-to-have-more-than-24-hours-in-a-day">previously hypothesized</a> that one of the biggest causes of my 
historical unhappiness is my unrealisticly high expectations of myself and my life, and that I might be happier were I able to lower those expectations. 
That might sound easy, but in practice it has turned out to be substantially harder than I had expected.</p>

<p>As much as I am enjoying this wave of newfound contentment, I am not so naive to think it will last forever, and it seems prescient to plan for one when 
things inevitably venture south once more. A good first step seems to be to try to internalise some new expectations.</p>

<p>The first trap is to think that if you set your expectations very, very low then you will be incredibly happy. If I repeat to myself 5x in the mirror every 
morning that my sole expectation is to wake up roughly once a day and respire consistently, then I’d be the happiest guy on earth. In actuality, our expectations run 
much deeper than that and are far more conditioner than at least I had initially realised. In all honesty, I’m not sure what the best way to change these 
internal settings is - but I think a good start would be to write them down, so here goes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I expect to wake up roughly once a day and respire consistently;</li>
  <li>I expect to make enough money to maintain my existing lifestyle;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to go to the gym at least 3x a week on average, unless I’m sick or travelling;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to eat less than 3000 calories a day, unless it’s a special occasion or I am particularly emotional that day;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to have no zero days;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to catch up with at least one friend a week;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to catch up with my brother at least every other week;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to learn at least one new thing about technology or my job every week;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to leave the house at least once a day;</li>
  <li>I expect to make slow but continuous progress in my career;</li>
  <li>I expect to make slow but continuous progress in the gym;</li>
  <li>I expect to make slow but continuous progress at chess;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to continuously try to express myself more openly and more honestly;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to continuously work on loving myself more;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to continuously try to learn more about the world and try to be a better person in general;</li>
  <li>I expect myself to write in this dumb blog every dumb day.</li>
</ul>

<p>These seem like they are still fairly lofty goals, but perhaps I will have to come down slowly. Good luck me.</p>
