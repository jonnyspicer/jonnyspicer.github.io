  <h1>Bands To See Before I Die</h1>

  </p>

  <p>Having decided that I have nothing better to spend my money on than travelling to see gigs, I’ve finally got around to compiling a list of
bands I want to see before I die (or before they do). Hopefully I can start crossing some of these off next time they are in the UK, although with 
bands on the list from as far as Japan, perhaps I’ll have to travel a little further afield to get to some of the shows I’m desperate to see.</p>
