  <p>After having spent 5 days in the Big Apple (although in some ways it feels a lot
longer), I feel like I can make something of a judgment about what it would be like
to live here versus my current tiny island home.</p>

<p>Oddly with NYC, I’ve yet to have the same feeling that I do in London: that ideas
are being exchanged, wheels are being set in motion, important decisions are being
made all around you. Perhaps New York is more commercialised, and it feels like
there is a much greater culture of consumerism here that takes away from any sense
that the machine merely needs feeding.</p>

<p>NYC also seems to be more multicultural than London, and obviously it is infinitely
more so than Guernsey. Seeing how many different kinds of people make up this particular
bustling metropolis certainly makes Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric that much
more disappointing, and indeed any other kind of intolerance pretty upsetting.</p>

<p>The food here is, naturally, amazing, but there are a <em>lot</em> of people, and both
the crowds and the pollution are inescapable, which would start to wear on me
were I hear for longer than a week. My anxiety has crept up on numerous occasions
but I’m happy to say that thusfar it’s all been manageable, and it hasn’t stopped
me doing anything. I think full time big city life is sadly not for me, but it’s been an
amazing opportunity to come and marvel at the skyline anyway.</p>
