  <h1>Climbing Progress</h1>

    29 Jul 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>At the expense of being preachy about my new active lifestyle as someone who both goes running <em>and</em> climbing, today I wanted to briefly mention
how great the latter is. I’ve been doing it for less than a month now, and during that time have already made some very satisfying beginner progress -
newbie gains for the win, and when you’re as bad as I am, the only way to go is up.</p>

<p>Today I had the particularly rewarding experience of topping a route that I had worked on for the last 3 or 4 sessions, managing (eventually) do each move
but not quite being able to put them all together until this evening, admittedly with a little help from a more experienced climber. In any discipline
feeling that your efforts are being reward with a sense of improvement is intensely enjoyable, and it’s pretty neat how climbing provides you with a very
measurable way of seeing said improvement.</p>

<p>Now to send the next route I’m working on, with a strong chance I brag about topping that when it happens as well.</p>
