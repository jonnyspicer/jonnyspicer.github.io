  <p>
  Last week I bought a bonsai tree, na誰vely assuming they would be as easy to
  care for as cacti. This week I learned that this is in fact not the case, and
  they are quite demanding as far as plants go. Most bonsai aren't even meant to
  be kept in doors - fortunately I accidentally bought one that is. I have to
  mist it, and try to keep it as humid as possible by leaving it near an open
  window and keeping its saucer full of water. It needs regular attention and
  I must care for its needs - what started as an ornament is rapidly becoming
  more like a pet.

<p>
  At first I was frustrated at my own idiocy and sought to take it out on the plant
  - to wreak vengeance by leaving it in the dry and the dark. But now I think I
  can grow to like it - as we sit side by side on the windowsill, and I gently
  spray its petite leaves with filtered water, our bond will strengthen and we
  might yet fall in love with one another.
