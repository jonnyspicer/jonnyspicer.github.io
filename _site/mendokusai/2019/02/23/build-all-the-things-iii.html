  I finally got around to doing some more Python today, and I decided to take
  a break from the data analysis side of things to try to do some scripting.
  I have a little bit of scripting experience in PHP/bash, but Python seems more
  flexible than both.

  The results were somewhat successful - I can now generate the template files
  for these blog posts from my command line. It only takes a few prompts, the
  title, flavour of blog, and tags, and then does a little bit of processing
  to create the correct file in the correct directory and add the relevant liquid
  front matter. It still needs some refining (right now it will open the file
  once created, but only on Windoze), but I am proud of it despite its simplicity.
  It was relatively straightforward and automates something I do every day - the
  potential to automate more things is something that excites me greatly.
