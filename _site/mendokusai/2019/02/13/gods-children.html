My God will not have created the Earth in 7 days, or sent their offspring to Earth (ironically, surely the realm of us mere mortals must be hell for a celestial being?), but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean she doesn&#39;t exist, in one form or another.

  <h1>God&#39;s Children</h1>

  <p>
  Today I met Elder Chung and Elder Howard, two members of the Church of Jesus
  Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They approached me in the street and usually I
  would've ignored them, but I didn't immediately realise that their true
  intention, instead thinking they would just ask me an innocent question and
  be on their way.
</p>
<p>
  We ended up talking for 10 minutes or so. They were nice people, and clearly
  not unintelligent, although I didn't exactly feel intimidated by their intellectual
  prowess either. We talked a little about life, the problems we all face, a
  search for answers, a desire for happiness that is common to each and every
  human being on the planet. They had a sense of altruism - they found joy
  in what they were doing and wanted to share that with other people, that
  they might find similar joy. In a lot of ways, I was completely on board.
</p>
<p>
  Until they told me they believed in a very literal (and specific) God - the
  specificty really bothers me. If you take 'does a Christian God exist?' as a
  Bayesian hypothesis, the starting probability is so staggeringly, infinitesimally
  small that I can't even theorize what kind of evidence would lead me to consider
  the hypothesis as having a meanginful probability of truth. Which is kind of
  a shame, because if they are truly happy, and I am not, then really the joke
  is on me, regardless of what I think about how they derive said happiness.
  Naturally I cannot overcome my existing thoughts and feelings about the nature
  of reality in order to share their viewpoint, so I do not think I will be
  joining the Church of Latter-Day Saints, but it did make me think if there is
  more to the whole spirituality thing than I've ever really given it credit it
  for. My God will not have created the Earth in 7 days, or sent their offspring
  to Earth (ironically, surely the realm of us mere mortals must be hell for a
  celestial being?), but that doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't exist, in one
  form or another.
</p>
<p>
  They also gave me a free book, which I thought was a pretty neat marketing trick.
  Startups, take note.
