  <h1>The Dual Pains of Injury</h1>

  Yesterday, I hurt my back while squatting in the gym. On the last rep of my
  top set, I felt a distinct crunch in my lower spine and immediately though "oh god,
  this could be really bad - this could be a disc injury". After 24 hours I am
  thankfully fairly confident that it is not so, given that I have full sensation
  and no pain in my glutes and legs, and it is just a muscular issue, presumably a
  spasm. That's little more than a silver lining though, as it is still agonising,
  and I can neither lie, sit or stand without pain. Walking is almost impossible,
  and I surely look like a fucking idiot when I try.
</p>
<p>
  So on one hand, the injury is phyically (very) painfully. But on the other it is
  similarly emotionally painful and injurious to my ego, as this was an entirely
  preventable injury and I even wrote about <a href="/mendokusai/2019/01/08/repeated-mistakes" target="_blank">
  pretty much the exact circumstances</a> it happened in recently - but this time
  the actual injury is worse, rubbing salt in the wound.
</p>
<p>
  The major contributing factors to this injury occurred wholly outside the gym.
  I have been constantly pushing myself in everything I do, as always, and the
  same is true in the gym, despite still struggling to get back into the swing
  of my programme after the Christmas holidays. If I try to put more effort into
  everything, of course something is going to slip, and on this occasion I was
  exceptionally lucky that that thing was not a disc.
</p>
<p>
  I am trying to fit so much into my days that I want to get my workouts done as
  quickly as possible, meaning I neglected to warm up as well as I should have,
  which is especially stupid on heavy squat days. I have also been hugely stressed
  recently, which inevitably takes just as much of a physical toll on my body as
  it does a mental and emotional toll on my mind.
</p>
<p>
  I should've had the self awareness to realise that I had a very high chance of
  injury by doing what I did, but sadly my ego, poor judgement, and distractedness
  got in the way, and now I am paying the price for it. I will probably unable to
  return to the gym for 1-2 weeks, and in that time I'll be seriously re-evaluating
  my current approach and goals within lifting and fitness
