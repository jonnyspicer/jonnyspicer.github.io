  <h1>The Grass is Greener</h1>

  <p>
  The phrase 'the grass is always greener [on the other side]' fills me with
  an incandescent rage when I am its intended recipient (and indeed a rather more
  tepid peturbation in any other context). Not only should it hold no place in
  mature and productive discourse, it is degrading, damaging, and should be
  removed from our collective lexicon forthwith.
</p>
<p>
  'The grass is greener' is the equivalent of a parent telling a petulant
  child 'because I said so', and has roughly equal merit as a logical counterpoint.
  It is wholly synonymous with the following: 'You are ignorant and naive. I am more
  intelligent than you; you are too stupid to see your own folly. Continuing this
  discussion isn't worth my time, because you are so dumb.' - and then abruptly
  turning away. Quite frankly, whenever someone uses the offending phrase in
  question and directs it towards me, I have to summon previously untapped reserves of inner
  fortitude in order to prevent myself retaliating with the refreshing honest
  rebuttal of 'go fuck yourself'.
</p>
<p>
  The expression implies that the grass is in fact, not actually greener on
  the other side, and that humans are conditioned to be unhappy with their
  own circumstances, forever trapped in the cycle of being desirous of
  other people's lives. The phrase essentially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwVNuyfhF0Q" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  paraphrases Homer Simpson,</a> saying 'why bother trying - even if you succeed, you will
  not find happiness'. In my mind, the joke is
  invariably on the speaker invoking the moronic platitude - clearly they
  are content with the waist deep mediocrity they are mired in, and do
  not think highly enough of themselves that they might be able to haul themselves
  free of it.
</p>
<p>
  The phrase is dangerous. While in a toxic relationship, it is easy to follow
  the greener grass fallacy - and think things would not be any better for you
  if you were rid of the very thing causing you pain. The same could be said of a
  job - your workload is overwhelming, your boss is callous and unempathetic, your
  clients excessively demanding and relentlessly unreasonable. You think to
  yourself that you should leave to find pastures fresh, where you might be
  happier. But then you remember that the grass is always greener on the other side,
  and that you are being a downright fool, and so you stay despite your present
  woeful predicament - which is ironically the infinitely more foolish thing
  than having the hope that you could bring about positive change.
</p>
<p>
  I refuse to bow down to the arrogant suggestion imposed by the phrase, that
  I should <a href="/mendokusai/2019/02/02/satisficing" target="_blank">satisfice</a>
  with my current situation. I welcome the implication that I am naive and
  idealistic, if it means I can retain the hope for a better future.
</p>
<p>
  Please, stop subjecting me to this ludicrous slogan.
