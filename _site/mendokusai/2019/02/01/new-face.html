  <p>
  Today I shaved my face down to the skin for the first time in around
  4 years. My chin has not seen the light of day for the last 1500 of them -
  I wonder what its take on the shift in the global political climate is.
</p>
<p>
  I expected to hate it, but I actually kinda don't - although I certainly don't
  love it either. But, given that everything else is changing, this felt like time
  for a facial change as well - time for a <a href="https://youtu.be/OwjPPaEyqhl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  new face.</a>
</p>
<p>
  I wonder if I'll start getting IDed in bars again now.
