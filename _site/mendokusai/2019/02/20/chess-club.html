  <p>
  Amidst the drudgery of the working week, chess club on a Tuesday night has
  provided a solaceful oasis recently. Having been a member for some 12 years now,
  I feel more than at home there, and I'm a veteran of the league despite being
  its youngest member. I am well liked and broadly like the other participants,
  although naturally some more than others. Differences are put aside, divisions
  forgotten, and everyone sits in quiet concentration trying to calculate their
  way through the labyrinthine nuances of a chess game. I can't help but feel
  that if more things in life were like chess club, the world might be a better
  place.
