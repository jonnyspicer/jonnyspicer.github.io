  Have you noticed that disruption is the new conformity in the tech world? Everybody
  is doing it, or at least they claim to be. The amount of start ups whose claims
  rely entirely on their disruption of whatever industry they're in is asymptotically
  approaching all of them. In my mind there is a deep irony to it, a lack of self
  awareness that ultimately already renders them failures in my mind.

<p>
  My hot tip for marketing your start up: pitch your service or product as one
  that will repair the damage already done, rather than one that will break all
  the rules.
