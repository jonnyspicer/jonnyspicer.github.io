  <h1>I Have Too Much Stuff</h1>

  <p>
  In the process of moving this week, I became cutely aware of how many boxes of
  largely superfluous possessions I had to painstakingly lug up and down
  multiple flights of stairs. I then compounded this by buying even more
  unnecessary trash, despite being already cogniscent that I had too much of it
  in the first place - everything I purchased, I had persuaded myself was 'essential'.
</p>
<p>
  Sure, perhaps I am as much a victim of capitalist dogma as the rest of us,
  and have just now become more acutely aware of it. But all these material
  goods weigh heavy on my soul - I can't help but wonder if I would feel
  a great sense of liberation on becoming free of it all.
</p>
<p>
  Naturally, I am far too scared to take the plunge and find out.
