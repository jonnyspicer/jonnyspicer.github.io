  Today I finally started meditating again, after not having done so for months
  (or maybe even years at this point). I am not doing it to find inner peace,
  seek enlightenment, or kill my ego - I am doing it because my present stress
  level is intolerable. Comfort eating isn't helping much and I regret it
  every time, and I am trying to find a more positive coping strategy - I am
  willing to try anything at this point, so back to sitting it is. Wish me luck.
