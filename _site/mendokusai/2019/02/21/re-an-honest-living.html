  <h1>RE&#58; An Honest Living</h1>

  <p>
  This week I read <a href="https://stevesalaita.com/an-honest-living/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  an excellent post by Steve Salaita,</a> in which he describes his journey from
  white collar to blue. It is a transition I have been toying with for years,
  at other times more seriously than others, although if I were to make the
  switch I am hopeful it would be altogether more voluntary than Mr Salaita's.
</p>
<p>
  I can't help but feel that working with my hands, doing something imperative for
  my community and my society, could be significantly more fulfilling. I have
  fantisized away many an afternoon at my desk dreaming of being an old time
  lumberjack, swinging my axe at the base of a tree in my plaid shirt and fur
  hat. I am terrified that I have a <a href="https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  bullshit job,</a> so going as far as possible in the opposite direction appeals
  greatly.
</p>
<p>
  So who knows, maybe I'll take after Steve and become a bus driver. I just need
  to find a particularly divisive issue to tirade about on Twitter to make
  myself unemployable in the tech industry first. I really can't recommend reading
  his article enough, if you have the time.
