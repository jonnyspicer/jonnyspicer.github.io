While roster changes have been made, some of the squad are veterans who have similarly been there since the beginning, and their resilience, as well as the organisations, is astounding. It takes something special to lose that many matches consecutively, and still bounce back and be able to win against a world class team. The Dragons also fielded the only female player in the league for their win - it was her first victory also.

  <h1>Shanghai Dragons</h1>

  <p>
    24 Feb 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  Last night the Shanghai Dragons beat Boston Uprising 3-1 in the first stage
  of the Overwatch League's 2019 season - the fifth stage that they have played in, as they have
  been a part of the league since its inception. This may not sound notable, but
  it is the Dragons' first victory in their entire tenure in top flight Overwatch -
  <i>their record before that was 0 - 41.</i>
</p>
<p>
  While roster changes have been made, some of the squad are veterans who
  have similarly been there since the beginning, and their resilience, as well
  as the organisations, is astounding. It takes something special to lose that many
  matches consecutively, and still bounce back and be able to win against a
  world class team. The Dragons also fielded the only female player in the league
  for their win - it was her first victory also.
</p>
<p>
  I think I have a lot to learn from the Shanghai Dragons, and I hope they go on to win
  many more matches this season.
