  </p>

  <p>
  In the recent various excitements (and as a result of having no broadband in our
  home), I completely missed the start of GSL Code S on Saturday. Actually, I
  forgot to even check what happened in the qualifiers - naturally I was delighted
  to discover that Scarlett had once again qualified, her achievement being all
  the more noteworthy given that she is the only non-Korean player to do so.
</p>
<p>
  While I may have missed Saturday's group, realising that the GSL was back and
  I would seen be spending my morning happily watching it gave me a sense of
  pure unadulterated joy - one that I could really use more of. I feel like I
  have already made every point I would like to make about esports in previous
  blogs, but in its ongoing struggle for mainstream legitimacy, today I realised
  it really doesn't matter to me. I was there when it was just kids in their basements,
  and I'll be there when it's bigger than football.
