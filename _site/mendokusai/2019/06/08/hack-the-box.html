  <h1>Hack The Box</h1>

  </p>

  <p>Yesterday I managed to <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">hack the first box</a>, that being the invite code for Hack The Box. I say ‘hack’ in the loosest sense of
the word because I have no idea what I was doing (also every step was basically the most obvious thing to try). Now I’m in, and I’ve spent a couple of hours
getting Kali set up (for the third time, yawn) in a VM, the VPN is configured and I can start attacking actual targets.</p>

<p>Except I have no fucking clue what I’m doing. Writeups coming later, if I ever do manage to get into anything.</p>
