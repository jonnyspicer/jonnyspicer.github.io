<p>My environment is habitual chaotic as is my brain, and while channeling my inner-Marie Kondo has at least temporarily aided the former,
the latter remains to be seen. One thing is clear, and that is that I need to throw a <em>lot</em> of stuff out, which I am excited for.
Having a more spacious life certainly seems plus EV.</p>
