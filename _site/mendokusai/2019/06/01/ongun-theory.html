  <p>We’re hosting this evening, and so this afternoon I took it upon myself to try to make our apartment look presentable (by which
I mean the bits of it that are ‘mine’ - Sam keeps his room and the communal areas immaculate). I was of course hoping to benefit
from the legendary WayneDaBang motto;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tidy environment, tidy mind.</p>

<p>My environment is habitual chaotic as is my brain, and while channeling my inner-Marie Kondo has at least temporarily aided the former,
the latter remains to be seen. One thing is clear, and that is that I need to throw a <em>lot</em> of stuff out, which I am excited for.
Having a more spacious life certainly seems plus EV.</p>
