  </p>

  <p>After 3 months of arduous back and forth with Oculus support (the result of which means I am never going to recommend their products to anyone, ever), my replacement controller has
<em>finally</em> arrived. As frustrated at disappointed as I am with their customer support, I do have that kid in a candy shop feeling all over again, of being able to dive back in to VR
experiences that I had all but forgotten that are truly wondrous and unique. I’m excited to spend all my free time being terrified by zombies running towards me, being made motion
sick by doing flips in cars, and pretending I’m a musical god by shredding it in Beat Saber.</p>
