  <h1>Altibox Norway Chess</h1>

  <p>
    04 Jun 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>Today is the first day of the classical portion of the Altibox Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger, and could be the beginning of a historical ten days.
With Magnus Carlsen a mere 14 points a way from the highest Elo rating ever achieved (naturally his own, from May 2014), a stellar performance in his home
country could push him back to those heights, with breaking the 2900 barrier than being firmly in sight. He has already had a near-unbelievable start to 2019,
winning three major tournaments without losing a game, but he’ll need a rating performance of close to 3000 in Stavanger to overtake his previous peak in the
live ratings, and those kinds of performances are rare.</p>

<p>Watching Carlsen grind down the best in the world is always a pleasure, and I will be firmly rooting for him all week.</p>
