  <h1>Commit Yourself Completely</h1>

  <p>In exciting news, Car Seat Headrest announced a new live album is coming on Monday. In even more exciting news, two of the songs were recorded at their show in London that I was at,
so you will be able to hear me singing along somewhere amongst the din.</p>

<p>While I wish CSH would hurry up and make another studio album, being able to tap into the feeling I had watching them play Beach Life-in-Death live on a streaming service is going to make me
happy for weeks to come.</p>
