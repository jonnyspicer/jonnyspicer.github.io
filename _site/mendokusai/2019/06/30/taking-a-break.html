  <p>I’ve decided to take a break from writing here daily, for a whole bunch of reasons, the main one being that I don’t have much time on most weekdays to do so and don’t feel that I have
been writing anything especially interesting here for a few weeks. Hopefully I will resume at some point, or get round to actually writing some longer pieces - none so far in 2019 is pretty poor!</p>
