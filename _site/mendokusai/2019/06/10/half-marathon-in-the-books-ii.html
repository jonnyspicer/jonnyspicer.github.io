  <p>Yesterday I lied, albeit accidentally - is it still lying if you belive it to be true at the time? Either way, today I decided to renege
on my vow to just train for the 10k and not do any more runs much past that, and signed up for the Fathers’ Day Half Marathon on Sunday.
In large part I did it because I was significantly less sore today than I was expecting, which can only be a good sign both for my general
fitness and my ability to do the same distance again in 5 days time. The route is a little easier and I am hoping that I’ll really enjoy the first
10 miles, but we’ll see!</p>
