I even got Windows Terminal to build and run correctly, so I now have a tabbed CLI on Windows without using a console emulator, which is ~very exciting~ something I can’t believe we’ve collectively had to wait this long for.

Starting from clean installs is actually super fun in my experience, somewhat akin to giving your machine a Cinderella-esque makeover, by the end she’s complete
with glass slipper IDEs, silken gown CLI tools and a splendid dark-theme-everything wig. I even got Windows Terminal to build and run correctly, so I now have a
