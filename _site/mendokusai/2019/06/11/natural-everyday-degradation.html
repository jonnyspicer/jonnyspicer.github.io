The album is by and large a slightly more produced version of Greatest Hits, with a marginally more upbeat tone while still likely being deserving of the emo tag. Eric’s voice features more (and rightfully so) and there are some more unusual instruments featured throughout, but I’m glad that Remo Drive had stuck to their sound despite signing to a comparatively big label - hopefully they will continue down that route rather than go the way of The Front Bottoms or Joyce Manor. Overall, I preferred the rawer aspects of their first effort and have never been a fan of clean production or polished sounds in general, but NED is still solid and well worth a listen - 7/10." />

  <h1>Natural, Everyday Degradation</h1>

  </p>

  <p>Today I finally got round to listening to the new Remo Drive record, ‘Natural, Everyday Degradation’. After their debut album, ‘Greatest Hits’ became
an instant emo classic I’ve been hugely excited for their follow up release, although much like their rest of their fanbase I was a little worried after
the controversy regarding their drummer leaving.</p>

<p>The album is by and large a slightly more produced version of Greatest Hits, with a marginally more upbeat tone while still likely being deserving of the emo tag.
Eric’s voice features more (and rightfully so) and there are some more unusual instruments featured throughout, but I’m glad that Remo Drive had stuck to their
sound despite signing to a comparatively big label - hopefully they will continue down that route rather than go the way of The Front Bottoms or Joyce Manor.</p>

<p>Overall, I preferred the rawer aspects of their first effort and have never been a fan of clean production or polished sounds in general, but NED is still solid 
and well worth a listen - 7/10.</p>
