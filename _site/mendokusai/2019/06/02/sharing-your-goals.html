  <p>I am (in my own mind) notorious for not following through - my execution sucks. I set big goals, which I sincerely believe are
achievable, I tell everyone about them because I’m so excited, and I do great for a month or two, and then I lose steam and stop
making any progress. I think it’s a trap a lot of people fall into, but I want to turn it around - I want to be the guy who
always underpromises and overdelivers, not the other round.</p>

<p>It’s <a href="https://blog.trello.com/science-backed-reasons-you-shouldnt-share-your-goals">pretty common advice at this point</a> to not
share your goals, so I’m going to try that.</p>

<p>I’ve got some big ones - but I’m not going to tell you what they are. You’ll have to try and guess.</p>
