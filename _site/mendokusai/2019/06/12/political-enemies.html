  <p>While following the Tory leadership contest in the news in the past few days, I can’t help but notice how almost without exception, each candidate
has made a point of emphasizing that they will be the leader capable of keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of 10 Downing Street. Now, I understand that party politicals
has an advantages, and perhaps I am being a bit of a naive millenial, but should keeping the opposing party out of government really be so high up everybody’s agenda?
