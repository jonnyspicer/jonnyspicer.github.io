  <h1>Half marathon in the books III</h1>

  <p>
    16 Jun 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>After <a href="/mendokusai/2019/06/10/half-marathon-in-the-books-ii">signing up on Monday</a>, today was the day, and I lined up at L’Eree with over
800 other people to run the 13.1 miles around the top half of the island before being back to town. I previously wrote that I was hoping
to enjoy the first 10 miles, and perhaps unsurprisingly, I didn’t - things started sucking a lot around mile 7, before they started <em>really</em>
sucking at mile 10. I didn’t really taper for this run (or even do much of the right kind of training) so I’m not sure what else I expected.
The important thing is ~I beat the guy wearing a hippo suit~ that I finished, despite quite how grim things were between Bordeaux and the finish.
During those final few ks, I once again asked myself why I was putting my body throught this experience, as it was far from enjoyable, but even
a couple of hours after the race was over I was already thinking about my next long run, goals, times etc.</p>

<p>And now, my focus really <em>is</em> on the 10k in September, a far more palatable distance.</p>
