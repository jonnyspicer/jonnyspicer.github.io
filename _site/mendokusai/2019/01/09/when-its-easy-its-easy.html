<meta name="description" content="For the last 10 days I&#39;ve been far less depressed than usual. So much so, you might say that for the last 10 days I haven&#39;t been depressed at all. Neat. One thing that strikes me about not being constantly fucking miserable is how easier pretty much everything is. It&#39;s easier to get up and go to bed earlier, it&#39;s easier to eat healthier, to go to the gym, to talk to friends. It&#39;s easier to sit down and write these posts. When I feel down, I still want to do all those things, but they take a lot of willpower. Even though they are relatively basic, getting them all done can take a lot out of me. Thinking about it now, I think this is one of the worst aspect of depression - performing simple tasks, tasks that you want to do, which will make you happier, becomes exhausting and can feel impossible. Whenever I&#39;m in a period of time where I&#39;m vaguely mentally healthy, I usually have two goals; firstly, to enjoy it fully, and secondly, to try to prepare for the next time things go south.

  For the last 10 days I've been far less depressed than usual. So much so, you
  might say that for the last 10 days I haven't been depressed <i>at all.</i> Neat.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that strikes me about not being constantly fucking miserable is
  how easier pretty much everything is. It's easier to get up and go to bed earlier,
  it's easier to eat healthier, to go to the gym, to talk to friends. It's easier to
  sit down and write these posts.
</p>
<p>
  When I feel down, I still want to do all those things, but they take a lot of
  willpower. Even though they are relatively basic, getting them all done can
  take a lot out of me. Thinking about it now, I think this is one of the worst
  aspect of depression - performing simple tasks, tasks that you want to
  do, which will make you happier, becomes exhausting and can feel impossible.

  Whenever I'm in a period of time where I'm vaguely mentally healthy, I usually
  have two goals; firstly, to enjoy it fully, and secondly, to try to prepare for
  the next time things go south. I'm doing a pretty good job of the former, and I
  want to progress with the latter, particularly in relation to making the basics
  less tiresome. Other than trying to be disciplined, build routines and internalise
  the habits as much as possible... I am open to suggestions.
