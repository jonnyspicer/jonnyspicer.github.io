  In terms of my never-ending quest to stave off chronic melancholy, this year
  has thusfar been a step in the right direction. Some things have been really
  bad, and some things have been really good. Overall, everything feels...
  Manageable. Sustainable perhaps. Something which has certainly not been the
  case in the past. The coin is balanced, for now. The question is, when will
  it topple, and what will I do then?
</p>
<p>
  Of course, it may stay upright, but assuming that to be the case seems na誰ve.
  I'm endeavouring to make the most of the positives, and allow myself to enjoy
  them as deeply as I allow myself to wallow in misery. As for the negatives,
  I am similarly endeavouring to change those, because when the coin is balanced,
  changing the bad things feels achievable. It will naturally be difficult and
  painful in many cases, but front-loading some of the discomfort will be more
  than worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
  I am genuinely hopeful that it's only going to get better from here.
