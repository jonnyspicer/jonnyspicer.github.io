  Today I spent <i>far</i> too much money on plane tickets, but I am very excited -
  this is my first Big Adult Holiday™. I am leaving work behind for two weeks and
  heading across the sea to the New York City, to go visit my best friend, along with
  another friend who I am excited to travel with and get to know better. I can't
  wait to get super fat on bagels, cheesecake and pizza, and learn to perfectly
  mimic a Lawn Guy Land accent. I'm gonna take a trip the Statue of Liberty,
  go see the Nets and then maybe bump into <strike>the President</strike> Pete
  Davidson. It's gonna be sick.
</p>
<p>
  It's going to cost a lot, and there's a lot of potential for me to get super
  anxious. But you know what, I don't care. This could be one of the best
  trips of my life, and I'm not going to let shallow pockets or a restless
  mind stop me from enjoying it.
</p>
<p>
  It's important for me to have things to look forward to when my health is bad.
  They're milestones, a place on the horizon that I can focus on slowly progressing
  towards. This one is gonna be a good one. USA, here I come.
