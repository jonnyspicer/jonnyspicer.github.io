<meta name="description" content="I&#39;m sure I have decried the concept of New Year&#39;s Resolutions in the past, but now I am older and supposedly wiser, I think they&#39;re actually pretty great. Sure - if you want to change your life, start now. But we all get trapped in cycles of habit - January 1st is a good opportunity to take a step back and evaluate, to try to set yourself onto a new path. I have failed at so many things in my life. There are so many goals I have set over, and over, and over again, seemingly oblivious to the many previous defeats I had faced. For the past couple of weeks, I have pondered whether it&#39;s worth setting the same goals, or any goals at all. Am I being naïve by saying I want to lose weight, improve my self esteem and become more connected to people? Who cares if I am. Naiveté is great - it gives me hope. Ignorance of potential negative realities of my situation is blissful. I don&#39;t want to give up on my idealism and by the same token I want to keep believing that I can change, even if I haven&#39;t managed it on previous occasions. My resolution last year was not to kill myself, and hey, I fucking nailed it. so I&#39;m gonna up the ante for this year. I&#39;m gonna lose weight and get jacked, I&#39;m gonna improve my self esteem (but not as a result of losing weight and getting jacked) and I&#39;m going to become closer to the people around me. Bring it on." />

  I'm sure I have decried the concept of New Year's Resolutions in the past, but
  now I am older and supposedly wiser, I think they're actually pretty great. Sure
  - if you want to change your life, start now. But we all get trapped in cycles
  of habit - January 1st is a good opportunity to take a step back and evaluate,
  to try to set yourself onto a new path.
</p>
<p>
  I have failed at so many things in my life. There are so many goals I have set
  over, and over, and over again, seemingly oblivious to the many previous defeats
  I had faced. For the past couple of weeks, I have pondered whether it's worth
  setting the same goals, or any goals at all. Am I being naïve by saying I want
  to lose weight, improve my self esteem and become more connected to people?
</p>
<p>
  Who cares if I am. Naiveté is great - it gives me hope. Ignorance of potential
  negative realities of my situation is blissful. I don't want to give up on my
  idealism and by the same token I want to keep believing that I can change, even
  if I haven't managed it on previous occasions.

  My resolution last year was not to kill myself, and hey, I fucking nailed it.
  so I'm gonna up the ante for this year. I'm gonna lose weight and get jacked,
  I'm gonna improve my self esteem (but not as a result of losing weight and
  getting jacked) and I'm going to become closer to the people around me. Bring it
