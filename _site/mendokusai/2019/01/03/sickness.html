  <p>
  Today, I am very sick. After all the excitement of yesterday, it is a little
  disappointing.
</p>
<p>
  But there is something important to learn from this bullshit fever I have. As the
  long worn-out proverb says, when you have toothache, all you can think about
  is the pain your jaw. When it subsides, you are filled with gratitude to the
  universe - but it never lasts. So, when I am better, I am going to try to hold
  on to the happiness of the status quo of my existence as much as possible.
