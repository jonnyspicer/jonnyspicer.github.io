  <h1>Beware of Dog III</h1>

    02 Jan 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  2019 is off to a flying start, I think I am happier today than any day I was
  in 2018. I feel like I could cry tears of joy. I know this feeling won't last,
  and it will hurt again soon, but I don't care. I want to enjoy these moments
  for what they are.
</p>
<p>
  I saw the dog again today. I got to play with, pick it up, feed it. And the most
  amazing thing happened - I didn't feel scared at all. And I knew I wouldn't
  be scared again in the future.
</p>
<p>
  I feel like I can see in colour for the first time, like a tumour has been removed
  from my brain and the chronic pain has finally ceased after years of grinding
  me down. It's an indescribable relief.
</p>
<p>
  To depart from the analogy for a second - the real reason I have managed to
  conquer this particular anxiety is through perseverance. It's taken a lot of
  work to get to this point, I wanted to give up so many times, but I didn't,
  regardless of the pain. And now it's finally gone. And it wasn't fluke - I actually
  did it myself. I didn't fail or underachieve, instead I achieved more than I ever thought
  possible.
</p>
<p>
  And if I can beat this, I can beat anything.
