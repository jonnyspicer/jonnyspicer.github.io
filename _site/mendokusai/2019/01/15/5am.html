  I am writing this at 5:15am, and have to leave in 30 minutes to catch a flight,
  so it is going to be quick.
</p>
<p>
  Today I get to go floating, see one of my favourite bands live and stay with
  one of my oldest friends. It has the potential to be an amazing day, and I
  am very excited. Without getting my hopes up too much, I think I'm going to be
  really happy.
</p>
<p>
  I'm sure I'll tell you all about it tomorrow.
