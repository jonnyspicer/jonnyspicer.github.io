  Have you ever noticed how nobody talks about the dentist? Your hear about
  people's visits to the doctor all the time, but not to her lesser cousin,
  the dentist. It almost seems taboo. I have no idea about the last time
  any of my friends went for a checkup - are they all in perfect health? Habitual
  flossers? Are their mouths riddled with holes, do they experience the pain
  and discomfort of the dreaded chair on a regular basis?
</p>
<p>
  These are all important questions, which I am dead set on finding answers to.

  (As you can tell, the only interesting thing that happened to me yesterday was
  that I went to the dentist. I need a filling next week, fuck me.)
