<meta name="description" content="Ever since I was a kid, I&#39;ve wanted to write a book. I remember when I was in primary school, resolving to pen a story 100 pages long, which at the time seemed like a feat that would bring me untold recognition and praise upon its completion. Naturally I didn&#39;t even come close to finishing it - my lack of execution obviously set in early in my life. About 15 months ago I first considered writing short stories, as a way to express myself and the struggles I was dealing with in a less self-absorbed way than chronicling my own experiences factually. Obviously I didn&#39;t ever get round to doing that either, because I am a perennially weak-willed, lazy individual. Recently I read a blog post (that I have not been able to rediscover in order to link or give credit to, sadly) that pointed out that if you wrote 200 words a day for a mere 125 days, you would be left with 25,000 words of writing, and many would consider that to be approximately one book&#39;s-worth. Well, I thought to myself, I write approximate 200 words a day, and I have done for the past 125 days or thereabouts. The issues were that firstly those writings were solely non-fictional, and I would have no interest in writing anything other than fiction; secondly that they are separate pieces and these incongruent and incoherent when viewed together; and thirdly that they are, by and large, perfectly fucking awful. I doubt there is much I will be able to do about the last one, but with some kind of concerted effort, I could surely remedy the former two problems. I clearly have it in me to write consistently enough to produce enough words to fill a book. Furthermore, when I was creating my reading list for this year, I tried to fill it with authors who I thought would inspire me, and whose influence I might be able to draw upon if and when I tried my own hand at writing fiction. Talking to an old school friend this week, who is infinitely better read than I, I realised another hurdle I would have to jump over. If I tried to write a book, I would want it to be of an insanely high standard. I&#39;d want to write like Proust or Dostoevsky. I&#39;d want my text to be as deep and nuanced as Infinite Jest. I might write 200 words in a day, but I&#39;d spend the next fortnight redrafting them. I would reject a million good ideas before finally settling on one, not because I was satisfied with it, but because I was frustrated at my own lack of progress. My vision of the plot would inevitably change often through the processes of planning, drafting and then editing. I would invariably find myself ensnared betwixt a desire to both emulate my literary heroes and also to produce something unique and original. Despite all this, perhaps I&#39;ll write a book one day. It might be fun, in a masochistic kinda way." />

  Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to write a book. I remember when I was in
  primary school, resolving to pen a story 100 pages long, which at the time
  seemed like a feat that would bring me untold recognition and praise upon its
  completion. Naturally I didn't even come close to finishing it - my lack of
  execution obviously set in early in my life.

  About 15 months ago I first considered writing short stories, as a way to
  express myself and the struggles I was dealing with in a less self-absorbed
  way than chronicling my own experiences factually. Obviously I didn't
  ever get round to doing that either, because I am a perennially weak-willed,
  lazy individual.

  Recently I read a blog post (that I have not been able to rediscover
  in order to link or give credit to, sadly) that pointed out that if you wrote 200
  words a day for a mere 125 days, you would be left with 25,000 words of writing,
  and many would consider that to be approximately one book's-worth. Well, I thought
