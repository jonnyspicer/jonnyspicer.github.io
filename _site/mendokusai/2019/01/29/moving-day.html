  <p>
  Today I am moving into a new flat, and it is the 4th time that I have moved
  out of my parents' with the intention of not returning. I hope it sticks this
  time, although I am not going to get my hopes up too much. I'm less excited
  than the previous times, now it feels like business as usual.
</p>

  I also spent about 6 hours trying to get Ubuntu working on a secondary SSD
  yesterday to no avail. The install process runs successfully, but open
  attempting to restart and boot into Ubuntu, my machine hangs when the BIOS
  hands over to grub. Send help :-(
