<meta name="description" content="In a recent post I talked about my pathological contrarianism and my need to dislike things people like to fuel some narcisstic superiority complex. It is, obviously, a negative quality to possess and one I would duly like to correct. So today, I&#39;d like to briefly admit that I actually quite like some pop music. Having watched this video with pop musician and producer Grimes, I was struck by something she said in one of the clips. For her, it was an obvious choice to pursue pop, despite any criticisms that it&#39;s a vapid or unfulfilling genre, because it&#39;s primary focus is the listeners happiness, or in her words: It&#39;s music that just seeks to hit the pleasure centre. And really, if I was critical of something with such pure intentions (let&#39;s pretend capitalism isn&#39;t a thing), I would be the asshole. My central criticism of pop is usually that it is not as interesting and emotionally engaging as other genres, and its over-commercialisation. If I were to start decrying everything I thought was unnecessarily commercialised, there wouldn&#39;t be a whole lot left. And just because something isn&#39;t emotionally engaging to me, especially given my melancholy disposition, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a valid art form. Besides, I do actually like some pop songs and artists, I&#39;m just too proud to admit it. The new Dua Lipa feat Blackpink song is awesome - admittedly I unashamedly loved Blackpink before hearing it. I adored Alice Merton&#39;s No Roots which was all over the radio last year. Billie Eilish is as much my Sad Queen as anyone else&#39;s. I am a big fan of Marina and the Diamonds, Kimbra, Lorde, and the aforementioned Grimes. Maybe if I got over myself and listened to more of it, I&#39;d be happier. Everyone else must like it for a reason." />

  <h1>In Defence of Popular Music</h1>

  <p>

  </p>

  <p>
  In a <a href="/mendokusai/2019/01/05/youtube" target="_blank">recent post</a> I
  talked about my pathological contrarianism and my need to dislike things people like
  to fuel some narcisstic superiority complex. It is, obviously, a negative quality
  to possess and one I would duly like to correct. So today, I'd like to briefly
  admit that I actually quite like some pop music.
</p>
<p>
  Having watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YcYTdwEfoc" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  this video with pop musician and producer Grimes</a>, I was struck by something
  she said in one of the clips. For her, it was an obvious choice to pursue pop,
  despite any criticisms that it's a vapid or unfulfilling genre, because it's
  primary focus is the listeners happiness, or in her words:
</p>
<p>
  <blockquote>
    It's music that just seeks to hit the pleasure centre.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  And really, if I was critical of something with such pure intentions (let's pretend
  capitalism isn't a thing), I would be the asshole. My central criticism of pop
  is usually that it is not as interesting and emotionally engaging as other genres,
  and its over-commercialisation. If I were to start decrying everything I thought
  was unnecessarily commercialised, there wouldn't be a whole lot left. And just
  because something isn't emotionally engaging to me, especially given my melancholy
  disposition, doesn't mean it's not a valid art form.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, I <i>do</i> actually like some pop songs and artists, I'm just too proud
  to admit it. The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX3Bsiq-13k" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  Dua Lipa feat Blackpink song</a> is awesome - admittedly I unashamedly loved Blackpink
  before hearing it. I adored <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Alice Merton's
  No Roots</a> which was all over the radio last year.
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiGm_E4ZwYSHV3bcW1pnSeQ" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Billie Eilish</a>
  is as much my Sad Queen as anyone else's. I am a big fan of
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Marinaandthediamonds" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Marina and the Diamonds,</a>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kimbramusic" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kimbra,</a>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LordeMusic" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Lorde,</a>
  and the aforementioned
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Grimezsz" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Grimes.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Maybe if I got over myself and listened to more of it, I'd be happier. Everyone
  else must like it for a reason.
