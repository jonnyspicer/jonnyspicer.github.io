  <h1>Sex Education Review</h1>

  <p>

  </p>

  <p>
  I just got done watching the new Netflix show 'Sex Education', so here is
  what I thought of it.
</p>
<p>
  The first two episodes paint the series as a fun, quirky coming-of-age story
  about the whacky hijinks of two teenagers who set up a 'sex clinic' to help
  their peers as they collectively endure puberty. One is the stereotypical
  rebellious genius, a feminine firebrand who is wholly apathetic to the thoughts 
  and opinions of others. The other is the awkward, nerdy-but-nice guy who
  stares at the floor when girls talk to him and hands in all his homework on time
  but only gets slightly above average grades. He's the son of a sex therapist
  and regurgitates his mother's advice to her clients in place of her own,
  while his counterpart handles client acquisition and cash flow.
</p>
<p>
  Initially the stakes are low, and I assumed I was in for a lighthearted, feel-good
  adventure with these two misfits and their assorted stereotypical friends. As
  it turns out, the writers had cunningly lulled me into a false sense of
  emotional security - Sex Education has claws.
</p>
<p>
  The show deals with a variety of social issues and makes its point in several
  raw, visceral scenes. Some of the plot points were very close to home for me,
  and I suspect that everyone who watches it will have been personally affected
  by one of the subjects raised. I cried at a couple of the episodes. The plot
  is obviously shaped in such a way as to serve the writers' agenda, which
  usually I would be highly critical of, but in this instance I will forgive it
  because of how well executed it was, and how much emotion it succeeded in
  eliciting from me, despite potentially being contrived.
</p>
<p>
  The show illustrates a reality of life that I found compelling. Sometimes,
  human existence can be difficult and painful for everyone, for kids, for parents,
  for women, for members of the LGBTQ community and PoC, and even for straight
  white cis-gendered men like me. But conversely, there are always moments of pure
  beauty and love to be found - often close at hand, if you look hard enough. It
  doesn't sugarcoat anything, nor shy away from showing the brutality of life
  (or male genitalia - I would definitely like to commend the show for having parity
  in this regard). Unlike a lot of other series, Sex Education evokes the whole
  spectrum of emotions - sometimes it'll put you on cloud 9, and sometimes it'll
  leave you a sobbing mess. I think that's what's so great about the show - that
  is exactly what real life is like.
</p>
<p>
  8.5/10, recommended assuming you have a box of tissues to hand.
