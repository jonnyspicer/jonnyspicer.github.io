  <h1>Non Linear Perception of Time</h1>

  <p>
  An odd one today, as I don't have much time to think any serious thoughts.
</p>
<p>
  Dear readers, have you ever stopped to consider how strange it is that time
  is the most linear experience one can have in this world, but that we do
  not perceive it that way? Sometimes hours pass in what feels like a matter of
  mere minutes, and other times we are staring at the second hand of the clock
  so intently, we feel that time itself has deliberately slowed to frustrate us.
</p>
<p>
  Can the perception of the passage of time serve as a qualitative marker for
  our experiences? Can I build it into my abstract goals - 'spend as much
  time as possible doing things that make the time pass'? In some ways I think
  it sounds like a reasonable goal, but shouldn't I be trying to savour every
  one of my tragically limited moments in this life?
</p>
<p>
  I don't think it really matters either way, but it's funny.
</p>
