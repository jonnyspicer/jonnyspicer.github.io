<meta name="description" content="Yesterday was my first session back in the gym after two weeks off, due to the holiday season and being ill. The building is a converted warehouse, so there&#39;s no heating and it&#39;s very cold in the winter, so even if you warm up, taking long rests in between sets can cause your temperature to drop quite quickly. Between that, still not being over my illness, and diving straight back into my programme after a fortnight&#39;s break, I should have been cogniscent of having a much higher injury risk than normal. There are no prizes for guessing what I did next. After 3 of 5 of my sets of squats, I felt my right hamstring become incredibly tight, and considered whether or not to continue. I knew it was the sensible thing to stop and doing something else, but for whatever reason I didn&#39;t, and proceeded to do my last two sets while trying to load my right leg as little as possible - hardly ideal for squatting. I massively compensated using my back and today it&#39;s inflamed and very painful; walking is difficult and I had to skip the gym. I saw this coming, so why did still I make the decision I did? Obviously it was calulcated risk - injury wasn&#39;t a certainty. But I have been injured in this exact scenario before, so it was highly probable. My decision making process broke down, and there are several reasons for that: ego - not finishing would be &#39;weak&#39; mentally, and in this case physically; desire for improvement - I am not content with where I am presently in my training, and I know I need to do the sets to get to where I want to be. I can&#39;t afford to make excuses, or I will not progess; guilt - I&#39;d just taken two weeks off, I need to make up for lost time; expectation - I&#39;d already set my expectations to do the whole session that evening, I did not want to fall short; laziness (of a kind) - making a conscious effort to change your plan takes effort, and a lot of times it is easier to simply stick with the way things are and deal with any potential consequences later. Of course, this is a relatively minor example of a bad decision. But, life is a series of decisions, and this one was something of a trap - furthermore, a trap I think we all fall victim to.

Another very human trait is to shirk our responsibility to confront our mistakes (especially if this isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve made them), and simply tell ourselves we will do better next time.

  <h1>Repeated Mistakes</h1>

  <p>
    08 Jan 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  Yesterday was my first session back in the gym after two weeks off, due to
  the holiday season and being ill. The building is a converted warehouse, so there's no
  heating and it's very cold in the winter, so even if you warm up, taking long rests
  in between sets can cause your temperature to drop quite quickly. Between
  that, still not being over my illness, and diving straight back into my
  programme after a fortnight's break, I should have been cogniscent of having
  a much higher injury risk than normal.
</p>
<p>
  There are no prizes for guessing what I did next. After 3 of 5 of my sets of
  squats, I felt my right hamstring become incredibly tight, and considered
  whether or not to continue. I knew it was the sensible thing to stop and doing
  something else, but for whatever reason I didn't, and proceeded to do my
  last two sets while trying to load my right leg as little as possible - hardly ideal for squatting. I
  massively compensated using my back and today it's inflamed and very painful;
  walking is difficult and I had to skip the gym. I saw this coming,
  so why did still I make the decision I did?
</p>
<p>
  Obviously it was calulcated risk - injury wasn't a certainty. But I have
  been injured in this exact scenario before, so it was highly probable. My
  decision making process broke down, and there are several reasons for that:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      ego - not finishing would be 'weak' mentally, and in this case physically;
    </li>
    <li>
      desire for improvement - I am not content with where I am presently in my
      training, and I know I need to do the sets to get to where I want to be. I
      can't afford to make excuses, or I will not progess;
    </li>
    <li>
      guilt - I'd just taken two weeks off, I need to make up for lost time;
    </li>
    <li>
      expectation - I'd already set my expectations to do the whole session that
      evening, I did not want to fall short;
    </li>
    <li>
      laziness (of a kind) - making a conscious effort to change your plan takes
      effort, and a lot of times it is easier to simply stick with the way things
      are and deal with any potential consequences later.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Of course, this is a relatively minor example of a bad decision. But, life is a
  series of decisions, and this one was something of a trap - furthermore, a trap
  I think we all fall victim to. Humans repeat their own poor decisions with such
  frequency that the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/surprised-pikachu" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  meme flavour of the month is very much dedicated to it (and a personal favourite
  of mine too).
</p>
<p>
  If I can improve the mushy grey inference engine between my ears then perhaps
  I will become a better, happier person. Another very human trait is to shirk
  our responsibility to confront our mistakes (especially if this isn't the first time we've made them),
  and simply tell ourselves we will do better next time. Perhaps this sounds familiar
  to you. But I think autopsying those decisions can provide a huge amount of value
  and direction on how to overcome wider issues in your life. I guess I just gotta
  get my hands dirty more often.
