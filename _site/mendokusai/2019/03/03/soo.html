  </p>

  <p>
  Today was the final day of the IEM Katowice Starcraft tournament, and it was
  an emotional one at that - soO, after coming 2nd in six GSL finals and a Blizzcon,
  finally overcame himself and emerged victorious by winning the IEM World Championship,
  After demonstrating that he was his own greatest opponent so many times, he proved
  himself a true champion by beating back his own mental demons and achieving his
  dream.

<p>
  In the interview, not only was he crying (a rare thing for the Korean pros), but
  the translator was moved to tears as well. I may have joined her.
