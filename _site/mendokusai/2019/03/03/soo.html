  Today was the final day of the IEM Katowice Starcraft tournament, and it was
  an emotional one at that - soO, after coming 2nd in six GSL finals and a Blizzcon,
  finally overcame himself and emerged victorious by winning the IEM World Championship,
  After demonstrating that he was his own greatest opponent so many times, he proved
  himself a true champion by beating back his own mental demons and achieving his
  dream.

  In the interview, not only was he crying (a rare thing for the Korean pros), but
  the translator was moved to tears as well. I may have joined her.
