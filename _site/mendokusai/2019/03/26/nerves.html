  <p>
  A long time ago, a fencing coach (who incidentally went on to coach the GB team)
  told me that "if you're not nervous about it, it's not worth doing". I was
  only about 13, but that phrase has stuck with me ever since. Of course, given
  I am a pretty anxious soul, I have anxiety about even basic things like
  leaving the house - but that is surely worth doing. The mantra has always
  helped me reframe my nerves, and ultimately allowed me to fight through them
  and achieve whatever needed achieving.

  I'm already nervous about my chess match tonight, which starts in half an hour.
  It's reassuring to know that this is something worth doing.
