  <p>
  A long time ago, a fencing coach (who incidentally went on to coach the GB team)
  told me that "if you're not nervous about it, it's not worth doing". I was
  only about 13, but that phrase has stuck with me ever since. Of course, given
  I am a pretty anxious soul, I have anxiety about even basic things like
  leaving the house - but that is surely worth doing. The mantra has always
  helped me reframe my nerves, and ultimately allowed me to fight through them
  and achieve whatever needed achieving.
</p>
<p>
  I'm already nervous about my chess match tonight, which starts in half an hour.
  It's reassuring to know that this is something worth doing.
