The majority of indviduals espousing the values of the far-right and far-left haven&#39;t spent any time doing any kind of research for themselves, they are simply swayed by the last thing they heard, and because they are now so inclined, they seek out more people who say similar things, only serving to reinforce their newfound beliefs.

  <p>
  Today I stumbled across the Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvsIonJdJ5E4EXMa65VYpA" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  ContraPoints,</a> who makes videos 'mostly discussing social justice issues and adjacent topics'.
  Usually I am incredibly wary of videos on Youtube that cover these kinds of topics
  as they are often polarising and inflammatory in nature, much akin to every other
  major social media platform, but the algorithm usually provides me with fairly
  solid recommendations, and I was intrigued by the thumbnail, so what the heck.
</p>
<p>
  I was pleasantly surprised with her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  video</a> on everybody's favourite fascim-hating fascist, Jordan Peterson. Her
  stance on the issues covered is of course heavily left-leaning, but she is capable
  of acknowledging valid and opposing viewpoints and does not use such dismissive
  rhetoric as Peterson et al often resort to. I found a lot of what she said both
  interesting and compelling, but in watching the video I was reminded of my own
  tendency to simply hold whichever opinion I absorbed last as my own.
</p>
<p>
  Clearly when discussing these kinds of topics, there are points to be made on
  both sides, and eloquent, intelligent individuals to articulate them to a wider
  audience. These are also complex and nuanced topics - ones that I would need
  to put in hundreds if not thousands of hours of research into in order to understand
  comprehensively or even formulate a viewpoint that I would defend with any degree
  of certainty. And because of that, I think the appeal of those who opine on these
  matters with confidence is obvious - we can regurgitate their opinions during
  polite conversation with friends, and be sure we have a somewhat defensible
  opinion without spending any time at all drawing our own conclusions.
</p>
<p>
  I think a huge number of people fall into similar traps, which are only intensified
  by the web's habit of entrapping them in echo chambers, and it is why polarising
  figures have seen so much success in recent years. The majority of indviduals
  espousing the values of the far-right and far-left haven't spent <i>any</i> time doing
  any kind of research for themselves, they are simply swayed by the last thing
  they heard, and because they are now so inclined, they seek out more people who
  say similar things, only serving to reinforce their newfound beliefs.
</p>
<p>
  But, like I said, I do this too, and I do not want to fall into this trap. So,
  sorry ContraPoints, but I'm going to remain perched squarely on the fence for now.
