  Today marks the third consecutive day on which I have gone to the gym, possibly
  for the first time in 2019. After having my routine disrupted by the holidays,
  then by injury, and struggling to get back on the horse with everything else
  already consuming time I don't have, I think I have finally set the coin on
  end once more. I'm very proud of myself, and ultimately I believe it is these
  sessions, even though I am not achieving much during them, that will be the difference
  between meaningful results in the gym or none.
</p>
<p>
  Let's see if I can make it four days in a row.
