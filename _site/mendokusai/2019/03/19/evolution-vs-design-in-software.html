  <h1>Evolution vs Design in Software</h1>

  <p>
    19 Mar 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  I am finally nearing delivery of my largest project to date at my day job, so
  it seems appropriate to share some of what I learned during its course. The
  topic today is that of software design vs software evolution, a fine balance
  which I didn't get totally right with the application we were building.
</p>
<p>
  By software design, I essentially mean planning the high level structure of the
  section of the codebase in question - likely by writing something akin to a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_description" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  software design description,</a> although in our case it would've been significantly
  less formal. In all likelihood, we would've just written down a bunch of classes
  and methods and wrote down what each one would need to do to get them to work.
  By software evolution, I mean eschewing that step, and simply mashing away
  at your keyboard with reckless abandon, with your code <i>evolving</i> into
  something with the functionality you want over time.
</p>
<p>
  The former option might sound like a no-brainer, but I think there are two
  important points to note in favour of the latter, particularly from the point of view of a
  relatively inexperienced developer such as myself. Firstly, when you are writing
  your SDD, there are things that you don't know you don't know - so it is difficult
  to account for them in your skeleton code. There are inevitably going to be challenges
  that you didn't foresee that mean you have to make changes to your SDD, and perhaps
  your code architecture has to change as a result. Secondly, I am a big believer
  in the <i>'all code is garbage'</i> mantra. With the evolutionary approach,
  you acknowledge and even expect to have to rewrite most of your code. Your
  first attempt is essentially a reconnaissance mission, to be replaced by
  the full army of your programming prowess once the lay of the land has been
  appropriately surveyed. The SDD approach imposes some rigidity which could hinder
  the outcome, as well as a certain reluctance to refactor or remove anything.
</p>
<p>
  I think the advantages of the software design approach are much more intuitive,
  although perhaps I will talk about them another day. The takeaway from this project
  was that it is at least a choice that must be considered, rather than simply
  rushing into the evolutionary method, as in the end I suspect the two often take
  an appreciably similar amount of time.
