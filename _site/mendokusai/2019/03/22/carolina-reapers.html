  <p>
  I've managed to get into a pretty good habit of meal prepping since having moved
  into the new flat, and last weekend I boldly made the choice to make a chili
  with the carolina reaper powder one of my colleagues gave me during the summer.
</p>
<p>
  Eating a portion of it takes at least 30 minutes when a regular serving
  would take 5, and at the end of each meal I am left sweating and crying.
  I feel manly AF though, 10/10 would heartily recommend.
