  I struggle to love myself. By which I mean that I don't love myself - the struggles
  involved had yet to bear any fruit. But I really want to change that, because
  my low self esteem seems to be the root cause of almost all of my unhappiness,
  and following several conversations and a lot of ruminating on the topic, I
  think I need to start carving out time in my day, every day, to devote to
  learning how to love myself. I really feel like I am starting from the beginning,
  but at least I am finally starting.
