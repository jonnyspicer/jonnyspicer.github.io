I still felt like my exploitative game was very good, and population tendencies don&#39;t seem to have changed much, if at all. With that being said, I am clearly still a gigantic tiltbox.

  Today saw the first couple of hundred of hands of PLO for me in 2019,
  and honestly, they were actually kind of fun. There were a lot of spots where
  I knew I ought to have folded, but didn't do so simply because I'm a fun player now,
  so I can punt my stuck off at the drop of a hat. I still felt like my exploitative
  game was very good, and population tendencies don't seem to have changed much,
  if at all.
</p>
<p>
  With that being said, I am clearly still a gigantic tiltbox. I was acutely aware
  of how emotional some of the decisions I made were, how attached to hands I would get,
  and how occasionally I didn't attach any rational thought whatsoever to a decision.
  But, the games are still <i>soft</i>, and if I could sort those issues out,
  I wonder if I could earn some extra pennies on the weekends.
