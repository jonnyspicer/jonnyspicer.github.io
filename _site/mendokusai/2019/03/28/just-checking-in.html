  While deep down a Hacker News rabbit hole this week, I discovered <a href="https://medium.com/message/just-checking-in-d2b5540f0064" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  this Medium post</a> (sorry to send you to everyone's least favourite blogging platform,
  but it can't be helped). It went some way to reinforcing me e'er-precarious faith
  in humanity, and I would go so far as to say it is one of my favourite things
  that I've read on the internet.
</p>
<p>
  The fact that two people can have such an intelligent and hilarious conversation
  that shows such a deep understanding of each other, <i>without ever having
  met in person</i> is a testament that technology can still be a positive force
  in all our lives. It's also a poignant reminder of our ability as people to
  feel empathy for another and express that in a beautiful way.
