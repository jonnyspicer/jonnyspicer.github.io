  Today is the first day of the GSL RO8 in 2019 and I am <i>very</i> excited. I am
  naturally a little sad that there are no non-Koreans this season, but there
  are a few potential underdog stories to make up for it, especially given
  that the likes of soO, INnoVation, Stats and sOs are already out. Will Maru
  continue his insane string of GSL wins, or will someone finally dethrone him?
