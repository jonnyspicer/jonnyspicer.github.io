  <p>
  I finally got round to playing (and beating) Celeste after having not given it
  the attention that it deserves for roughly a year. Now that I have, I'm incredibly
  glad I did so - this game is engaging, challenging and gorgeous. The gameplay is
  great, a solid and polished platformer with some interesting mechanics, but what
  really shines is the story. I can't remember the last time I was so emotionally
  involved in a single player experience like this - Celeste hit worryingly close
  to him and I was moved to tears on multiple occasions.
</p>
<p>
  I was aware beforehand that the themes in the game were mental health-ish, but
  when I began playing and realised that my objective was not only to climb
  Celeste Mountain but was also to overcome the protagonist's anxieties and self
  doubt, it quickly became analagous to my own life. After only playing for an hour
  or so, I knew I was going to have to complete the entire game, no matter how
  long it took - not overcoming Madeline's internal demons felt like it would be
  losing to my own.
</p>
<p>
  A truly remarkable game, thoroughly worthy of the deluge of praise it has
  experienced since its inception, and birthed from a game jam no less! Now to
  get all the collectibles...
