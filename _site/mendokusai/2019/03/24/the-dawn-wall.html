Without giving too much away, Caldwell endures some remarkable hardships - which would be insurmountable for mere mortals - and overcomes them all to become one of the most legendary climbers ever. The film showed not only what limits humans can push their own bodies and minds to, but also offered a glimpse into the acts of compassion we are capable of. Overall, an uplifting and inspiring watch, and one which I would strongly recommend." />

  <h1>The Dawn Wall</h1>

  <p>
    24 Mar 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  This morning I watched The Dawn Wall, the story of Tommy Caldwell and Kevin
  Jorgesen becoming the first people to free climb 'The Dawn Wall' route of El
  Capitan in Yosemite.
</p>
<p>
  While I didn't enjoy it quite as much as free solo, it was still an incredible
  100 minutes of a documentary, and Caldwell's story is a remarkable one. Without
  giving too much away, Caldwell endures some remarkable hardships - which would
  be insurmountable for mere mortals - and overcomes them all to become one of
  the most legendary climbers ever. The film showed not only what limits humans
  can push their own bodies and minds to, but also offered a glimpse into the
  acts of compassion we are capable of. Overall, an uplifting and inspiring watch,
  and one which I would strongly recommend.
