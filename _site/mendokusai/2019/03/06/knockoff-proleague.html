  Proleague is back! Well, kind of. Naturally I wish it was still an offline event
  in Seoul, but the new Chinese team league is exciting nonetheless, and even
  if the quality won't be quite as high as Proleague at its peak, there are still
  plenty of players I am excited to watch, and the format is solid.

  I will of course be rooting for Scarlett and her team, Newbee, but Jin Air Greenwings
  are definitely, definitely going to win. I have spent the past couple of years
  pining for a top level team league to grace my mornings, so I am very excited
  that one has finally returned!
