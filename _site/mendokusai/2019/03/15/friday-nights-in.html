  <h1>Friday Nights In</h1>

    15 Mar 2019
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  I'm getting old. Like, upsettingly old. Once upon a time I would've considered
  the idea of a quiet Friday night in heretical, and decried the notion that I might
  spend one such evening that way as blasphemeous and a grave personal insult. But
  now here I am, an alleged adult, living in accomodation that's not being paid
  for by my parents, enjoying a beer by myself on a Friday night.
</p>
<p>
  And I am loving it - which is how I know I'm old. For all the worry I may
  have had during the week about my career, my bank balance, my social and  love lives, and
  all the assumptions I made that progression in those things would make me happy -
  evidently that's unnecessary. This evening, even if it might sound 'depressing'
  to an observer, has brought me a lot of joy - simply playing video games and
  drinking Staropramen on my own.
</p>
<p>
  It's served as an important reminder that happiness is far less complicated than
  I always think it is - it's just well concealed. Na zdraví.
