  <h1>Listening</h1>

  </p>

  <p>I had, until recently, considered myself to be quite a good listener, however I have had the rather
painful realisation that that is in fact not the case, and I suck at it. I think being able to really
listen to someone and engage and take on board what they’re saying is one of the most admirable 
qualities that one could possess, and so it’s something I would like to get better at. Knowing that
I’m bad seems like a good place to start, but the next step I think is talking less.</p>

<p>With the goal of talking less and listening more, writing a blog every day feels pretty uncomfortable.
Maybe I’ll scale it back, or talk about myself less, or ask more questions, or have more guest posts.
Either way, I’ll try and share what I learn from listening more.</p>
