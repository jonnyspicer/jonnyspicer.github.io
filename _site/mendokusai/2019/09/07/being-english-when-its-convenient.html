<meta name="description" content="One of the neat things about being from Guernsey is that I can essentially be English when, and only when, it is convenient. For example, in the 2003 Rugby World Cup final, I distinctly remember being English, and the same is true of the 2005 Champions League Final, and more recently in the Cricket World Cup earlier this year. Sadly, today cricket is the source of my absolutely-not-Englishness, as Australia are absolutely thumping England in the fourth test of the Ashes. So, I have returned to neutrality, and will swear no fealty to any team that isn’t flying the Guernsey banner. Incidentally, what even is Steve Smith? The man is a monster." />

  <p>One of the neat things about being from Guernsey is that I can essentially be English when, and only when, it is convenient. For example, in the 2003 Rugby World Cup final, I distinctly remember
being English, and the same is true of the 2005 Champions League Final, and more recently in the Cricket World Cup earlier this year. Sadly, today cricket is the source of my absolutely-not-Englishness,
as Australia are absolutely thumping England in the fourth test of the Ashes. So, I have returned to neutrality, and will swear no fealty to any team that isn’t flying the Guernsey banner.</p>

<p>Incidentally, what even is Steve Smith? The man is a monster.</p>
