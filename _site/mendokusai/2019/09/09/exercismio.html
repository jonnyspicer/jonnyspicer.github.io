<meta name="description" content="In the past week I’ve been trying out exercism.io, and so far I’ve been really impressed. It sits in between the Leetcode-style of completing coding challenges and Codecademy or similar progressive learning of a language, with the very nice touch that human mentoring is available, and a real person will make comments and suggestions about your code. This human feedback, as well as the ability to easily compare your solutions with others, has provided me with a lot of insight into how C# works, and the different considerations and possibilites when using it to solve even comparatively basic problems. Amazingly, Exercism is free, although in all honesty I think I would probably pay for it, so it comes with my hearty recommendation." />

  <p>In the past week I’ve been trying out <a href="https://exercism.io">exercism.io</a>, and so far I’ve been really impressed. It sits in between
the Leetcode-style of completing coding challenges and Codecademy or similar progressive learning of a language, with the very nice
touch that human mentoring is available, and a real person will make comments and suggestions about your code. This human feedback,
as well  as the ability to easily compare your solutions with others, has provided me with a lot of insight into how C# works, and
the different considerations and possibilites when using it to solve even comparatively basic problems. Amazingly, Exercism is
free, although in all honesty I think I would probably pay for it, so it comes with my hearty recommendation.</p>
