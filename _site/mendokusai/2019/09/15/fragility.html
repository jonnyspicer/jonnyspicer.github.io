  <p>One of the aspects of the toxic masculine stereotype I don’t think I’ve really touched upon previously is this idea of solidity and robustness, that men must be wholly unwavering in their dedication
to not showing weakness. Obviously that is not a reality, and recently my own emotional state has been especially fragile, today I am doing better than I have been in a while, but it still feels
worryingly precarious. In the popular common consciousness, men do not seem to have this capacity for emotional fragility, but I feel like something small could send me spiraling very easily from
a place of otherwise relative contentment.</p>

<p>I don’t know. It’s been a rough week. But it will get better.</p>
