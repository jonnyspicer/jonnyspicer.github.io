<meta name="description" content="Having been writing here for quite a while now, the way I feel about the process is slowly levelling it. The motivation comes and goes in waves, both that I go through weeks or months of having a lot to write about and being excited by it, and also in the sense that if I am tired or sad one day I want to write less. I also don’t really like what I write, and am rarely happy with my output - until some amount of times goes by. There must be a threshold amount of time somewhere, but rereading posts that are several months old, they are always far more enjoyable then when they’re fresh off the press for me. Being able to easily remember exactly how I felt when I wrote those particular words, and slide back into an emotional snapshot from the past, is something that brings me a lot of comfort, happiness and perspective." />

  <p>Having been writing here for quite a while now, the way I feel about the process is slowly levelling it. The motivation comes and goes in waves, both that I go through weeks or months of
having a lot to write about and being excited by it, and also in the sense that if I am tired or sad one day I want to write less. I also don’t really like what I write, and am rarely happy
with my output - until some amount of times goes by. There must be a threshold amount of time somewhere, but rereading posts that are several months old, they are always far more enjoyable
then when they’re fresh off the press for me. Being able to easily remember exactly how I felt when I wrote those particular words, and slide back into an emotional snapshot from the past,
is something that brings me a lot of comfort, happiness and perspective.</p>
