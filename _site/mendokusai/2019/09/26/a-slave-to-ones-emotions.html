  <h1>A Slave to One's Emotions</h1>

  </p>

  <p>Being a slave to one’s emotions is tedious and draining, pulled apart in all directions even
during the course of a day, knowing full well what is happening but still unable to stop it. I
wish it weren’t the case, but it frustrates me a lot. Mindfulness alleges that it can help
create a pause in between emotional stimulus and response, and perhaps that is exactly what I
need.</p>
