  <h1>Should I Call Myself a Feminist III</h1>

  </p>

  <p>I’m already not especially proud of the <a href="/mendokusai/2019/05/06/should-i-call-myself-a-feminist">first</a> <a href="/mendokusai/2019/05/07/should-i-call-myself-a-feminist-ii">two</a> posts I wrote with this title, and that is despite them being only a little over 4
months old. The cynicism and defensiveness displayed therein is not becoming of me and does not represent the qualities which I
would like to embody. Attempting to shirk responsibility and fearing admissions of guilt are not things I admire, and things I had
hoped were not in my nature, however I think those two posts make it quite clear that they very much are.</p>

<p>Rather than attempt to further justify my flaws, acknowledging and attempting to correct them would put me much more in line with the
kind of person I want to be. Social inequality is a serious issue, and there are problems arising from it that I both tacitly and
actively perpetuate and endorse. Trying to rationalise away my actions, to absolve myself of blame to avoid cognitive dissonance is
no longer acceptable.</p>

<p>I’ve arrived at this (after a lot longer than I should have) after finally realising how much it hurts the women around me - women I
love and care about. In my desperation not to find fault with myself, I have always been blind to how much pain our society really
does to women, but now I have felt it in those close to me, I can’t willfully ignore it.</p>

<p>It might feel uncomfortable, and I might feel undeserving, but those things pale in comparison. I am a feminist.</p>
