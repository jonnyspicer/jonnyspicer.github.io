  <p>After having mused back in April that [perhaps I should reconsider my stance on pictures], today I would like to fully admit that I used to be wrong about them. Photos are great - it’s forced smiles that aren’t,
so the trick is not to force them. In the past few weeks I’ve been struck by a certain amount of remorse that I’ve not taken more pictures of my summer, with my friends and loved ones. I can think back to the moments
I shared with them and smile, but I have looked at the handful of pictures I do have a hundred times over, they make it all the easier to transport myself back to that moment and tap into the feeling I had then.
I’m definitely going to take more pictures in the future, and complain less about having them taken of me. You’ve still got to tell me a joke beforehand though.</p>
