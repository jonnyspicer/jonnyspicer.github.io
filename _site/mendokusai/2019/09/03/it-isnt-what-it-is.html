  <p>One of my least favourite English phrases is “it is what it is”. An expression of unwavering stoicim, it is used to detach emotionally from a situation, to refuse to acknowledge pain, fear, shame or doubt, to put an end to a conversation and sever
a potential moment of human connection. It is not the sign of strength those who utter it might think, it is an excuse, a
denigration of modern masculinity and I loathe it.</p>

<p>If I say it ever again, please direct me to this post and remind me that I’m being dumb.</p>
