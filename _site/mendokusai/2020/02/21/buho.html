  <p>Tonight I’m going to a fancy Mexican restaurant. Only, the thing is, as someone who can now pretentiously claimed that they lived in Mexico briefly, I know there’s no such thing as an
<em>authentic</em> fancy Mexican restaurant. If it isn’t fried in 3 pigs worth of pork fat and served
to you by a 400lb, 5’2 Mexican lady who clearly hates you because you’re white and your Spanish
sucks, then it simply isn’t legitimate Mexican cuisine.</p>

<p>Fortunately, fake-ass fancy Mexican is still <em>super</em> tasty and the tequila tastes the same either
which way.</p>
