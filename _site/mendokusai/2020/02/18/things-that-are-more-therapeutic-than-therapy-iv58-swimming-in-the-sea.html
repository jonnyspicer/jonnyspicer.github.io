  <p>My GP spent a good portion of our January appointments trying to persuade me that I should join the local sea swimming group, and that it would be good for my mental health. I
would’ve been infinitely more open to the idea in any other month, but January just seemed a little too optimistic. Now we’re knee deep in <del>clu</del> February though, I
decided to take the plunge, both figuratively and literally, and joined them bright and early at 7am this morning. The air temperature was an invigorating 8 degrees celsius,
and I don’t want to even think about what the water temperature was. It was bracing, invigorating, and life-affirming, but really the best bit was what came after. Once I’d
managed an entire length of the pool (!!) we got out and peered east, across the water to Herm and Sark, silhouetted by the dawn. And then, to warm up, one of my newfound
swimming companions showed us some kind of dance/chant/thing to warm up as we faced the sun. Sharing that, with complete strangers, was how I think life should be.</p>
