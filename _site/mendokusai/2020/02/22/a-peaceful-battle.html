  <h1>A Peaceful Battle</h1>

  <p>
    22 Feb 2020
    
    
  </p>

  <p>A lot of people are surprsied when I tell them how long our
chess league matches take - at least a couple of hours - and
seemingly can’t imagine spending so much time doing so little. But I find it very easy these days, and in fact I
would happily do it for longer if I had the chance. I find
the game very meditative and present - when I sit down to play, nothing else in the world matters, or even really exists, there is simply myself, my opponent, and the board.
It’s a wonderful opportunity to have a comparatively quiet
mind for a couple of hours every week, and I would strongly
recommend it to all.</p>
