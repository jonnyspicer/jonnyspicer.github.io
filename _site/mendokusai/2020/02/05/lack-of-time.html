  <p>Once again I’ve not found enough time to be able to write properly about what has on my mind today, which I am a little frustrated with myself about. With that being said, here
is what is hopefully to come in the following week on the blog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Life, broken systems and the prisoner’s dilemma;</li>
  <li>Poker;</li>
  <li>Clean Language;</li>
  <li>Kobe/Jacob;</li>
  <li>Saving people and saving oneself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I have to dash to a social event which I organised, which includes an insane 14 person dinner reservation - almost certainly this is the biggest event that I have birthed
and coordinated myself. Don’t these people have better things to do with their time?</p>
