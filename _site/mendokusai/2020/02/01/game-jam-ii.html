  <h1>Game Jam II</h1>

  </p>

  <p>This year I am once again participating in the <a href="/mendokusai/2019/01/27/game-jam">Global Game Jam</a>, and after approximately 28 of our allotted 48 hours, we have already produced
something leaps and bounds ahead of last year’s effort. It has been frankly exhausting, but this time I can say that I’m genuinely proud of the work that myself and our team
have done and what we’ve been able to make in such a short period of time.</p>

<p>Tomorrow our game will theoretically be available to play on the internet, so I’ll post a link and write a little more about it after the event is over.</p>
