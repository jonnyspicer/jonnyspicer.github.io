  <h1>Poker Hand Stories</h1>

  </p>

  <p>After talking to Ongun and Marisa this week, and describing an emotion wholly unrelated to poker through the analogy of a poker hand
(much to Marisa’s dismay), I realised quite how powerful the emotions that poker hands carry with them. So much so that I find it
easier to convey almost any feeling to another player simply by conjuring up a hand in which I would feel such a feeling as I am
trying to describe, and knowing that they understand me better that way than they would should I try to express myself any other
way. It’s quite funny to think about, and makes me feel happy and special to be able to share this esoteric connection with only
a handful of people.</p>
