  <h1>Publishing blogs is hard</h1>

  </p>

  <p>Perhaps this post should be entitled ‚Äúleaving a job half done‚Äù. I have good very good at <em>writing</em> a blog post every day, however it seems I am struggling to successfully
publish them, despite having a python script that theoretically handles the whole thing for me. The problem is of course that I have done half a job writing it, and that it
sort of does what I want, but the test is half written, and it has been left in a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù state that frankly isn‚Äôt good enough, and it has already cost me 1 ETH, coming
dangerously close to costing me a second today.</p>

<p>The good news is that I am going to spend my weekend writing it properly, and making sure I have a proper pipeline and alerting system too. Sorry Ted üòÑ.</p>
