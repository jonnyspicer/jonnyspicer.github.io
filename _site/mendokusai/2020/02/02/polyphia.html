I’ve also managed to schedule in a home game, an ale festival, and potentially another tattoo appointment into just 3 days, and now I am incredibly excited! Spending money on these kinds of experiences has slowly become more and more of a no-brainer to me. Everything else seems completely pointless where I to choose to continue to hoard it away, like Smaug on my pile of gold.
