  <h1>Infinite Jest&#58; I've Written a Novel</h1>

  <p>
    24 Feb 2020
    
    
  </p>

  <p>Last year, Josh and I had a conversation about how we’d never write a novel, because we’d want it to
be our own Infinite Jest, and neither of us are any David Foster Wallace. It seemed like a thankless
creative endeavour as we would both set wholly unrealistic and unattainably high bars for ourselves,
and so we would simply never even try.</p>

<p>Having said that, according to my <a href="https://github.com/jonnyspicer/jonnyspicer.github.io/blob/master/wordcount.py" target="_blank">calculations</a>, I’ve actually written enough words in the last 3 and a bit years to
constitute a fairly beefy novel: approximately 150,862 (in reality it is probably higher as that
script only splits words by spaces, and I quite like doing that-thing-where-you-hyphenate-all-the-words). According to <a href="https://self-publishingschool.com/how-many-words-in-a-novel/" target="_blank">this completely arbitrary source</a>, that’s more words than any
category of non-technical book they list. Admittedly, it’s still not quite Infinite Jest, which,
according to Ryan Compton, weighs in at a hefty <a href="http://ryancompton.net/2014/06/06/statistical-features-of-infinite-jest/" target="_blank">577,608 words.</a> Clearly a lot of my words are (exceptionally) low quality,
but still, I clearly have it in me to write the kind of volume required for a novel, and in a
reasonable amount of time, as I am demonstrably not a full time writer, nor do I consider blogging
a hobby, it usually only occupies ten minutes of my day. So, perhaps, one day…</p>
