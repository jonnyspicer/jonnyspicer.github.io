  <h1>100 Favourite Albums of All Time</h1>

  <p>I’ve been thinking a lot in the past few days about how music makes me really, really happy in a way that few other things do.
Originally I was going to try and write a “top 10 favourite albums” post but that ended up bleeding into 50, which subsequently
bled further into 100, which finally resulted in a list of roughly 150 albums. That seemed like a terrible number though, so I
managed to cull it down to a nice even hundo, and here they are in no particular order.</p>
