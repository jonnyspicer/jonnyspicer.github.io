  </p>

  <p>Today is the 18th of January, meaning the blog-a-day last longer bet is back, and I am very excited! I will get to read the thoughts of a good friend and practice articulating my own every single day. And
then at the end of it all, his money is going to buy me a very expensive steak, and what could be a more enticing prospect than that?</p>

<p>I will spend the next few days meditating on the lessons and prop bet wisdom I learned from Joey Ingram himself, before gleefully rubbing my hands together and riding off into the sunset, furiously typing out
post after post.</p>
