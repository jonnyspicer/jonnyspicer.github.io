  <h1>Welcome Back to the Black Parade</h1>

  <p>
    24 Jan 2020
    
    
  </p>

  <p>Tickets for My Chemical Romance’s first show in the UK since 2011 went on sale today at 9:30am. On the 20th June, the band will be
playing in Milton Keynes as part of their reunion that started last month in LA. The ticket vendors’ sites struggled to keep up
with demand, with one crashing pretty much immediately as the clock struck half past, with others placing would-be concert goers
into queues in order to try to process them in an orderly manner. Unsurprisingly, the show sold out quickly. Fortunately, I got
three tickets.</p>

<p>In June, I am going to have the experience of standing in a crowd of tens of thousands of people as the band play the first note
to their beyond iconic song, “Welcome to the Black Parade”, the legendary G note which is embedded deep within all of our psyches.
I can’t think of the last time I was this excited about something.</p>
