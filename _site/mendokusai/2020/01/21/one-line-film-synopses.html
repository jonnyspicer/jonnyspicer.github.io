  <p>In my recent absence from blogging, I managed to make my way through a respectable number of films, and I thought it’d be fun to
write one-line synopses for them all - these all have spoilers to some degree!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="train-to-busan">Train to Busan</h3>
<p>Hot-shot stock trader has head so far up his own rectum it takes the literal apocalypse for him to realise that he should spend more
time with his daughter.</p>

<h3 id="the-dead-dont-die">The Dead Don’t Die</h3>
<p>Adam Driver and Bull Murray are weird, Tilda Swinton is extremely weird, Chloe Sevigny is the only person who reacts proportionately
to anything that goes on in this film.</p>

<h3 id="zombieland-2">Zombieland 2</h3>
<p>Jesse Eisenberg’s continued romantic success with Emma Stone in this movie continues to perpetuate my own incredibly unrealistic
expectations about beautiful girls reciprocating my affection.</p>

<h3 id="human-centipede-1">Human Centipede 1</h3>
<p>Weird fetish-horror-porn with no self awareness whatsoever; the dialogue was so bad I was honestly somewhat relieved when the
characters were sewn together so they could no longer speak.</p>

<h3 id="human-centipede-2">Human Centipede 2</h3>
<p>Weirder, more horrific horror-porn catering to an even nicher fetish; despite obviously knowing it’s not real, probably more
disturbing to me than any of the myriad of things I have seen on the internet that I am reasonably certain were real.</p>

<h3 id="human-centipede-3">Human Centipede 3</h3>
<p>The writers finally acquired some self-awareness, a budget, and Bree Olson, making this film actually somewhat enjoyable once
you’ve been desensitised to the absurdity of the trilogy.</p>

<h3 id="hereditary">Hereditary</h3>
<p>A 25 year old highschool student accidentally kills his sister and subsequently becomes the earthly incarnation of Satan.</p>

<h3 id="midsommar">Midsommar</h3>
<p>The penny finally drops for an American student that she deserves better than her boyfriend when they join a pagan cult in rural Sweden and they offer to murder him for her.</p>

<h3 id="the-lighthouse">The Lighthouse</h3>
<p>Robert Pattinson suffers a psychotic break after extensive bullying by a seagull while Willem Defoe mistakenly believes this is an
adaptation of a Shakespeare tragedy.</p>
