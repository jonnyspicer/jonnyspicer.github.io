He’s a man who is willing to do what must be done - one trait from old male archetypes I think worth still praising - he puts his brother before anything, has a bulletproof sense of loyalty and honour, he’s smart, and he’s an insanely powerful ninja who can set things on fire with his eyes. Perhaps the last one is less than attainable, but I quite like the rest of them." />

  <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about what kind of man I want to be lately, and looking for suitable male role models in our post-feminist age. It struck me while running today that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha" target="_blank">Itachi Uchicha</a>, while not quite being a role model per se (not least because of his fictitious nature), embodies many qualities that I aspire
to. He’s a man who is willing to do what must be done - one trait from old male archetypes I think worth still praising - he puts his brother before anything, has a bulletproof sense of 
loyalty and honour, he’s smart, and he’s an insanely powerful ninja who can set things on fire with his eyes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the last one is less than attainable, but I quite like the rest of them.</p>
