  <p>It’s been a week of working from home and leaving my flat solely to exercise, bar one trip to the supermarket on Monday
which was intended to last two weeks. I was frankly expecting to be incredibly depressed by this point, and there is
certainly still plenty of time for that to happen, but at least so far I’m actually… not?</p>

<p>Some mixture of the improved weather, newfound extra time allowing for new acts of self-care in my routine, and extra
effort being made by a lot of my friends to keep in touch is keeping my afloat. Naturally I hope the pandemic can be
stemmed as soon as possible, but after this week, I’m glad that I feel somewhat more prepared to deal with the eventuality
that it continues for longer than we’d all like.</p>
