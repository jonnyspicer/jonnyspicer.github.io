  <p>Yesterday I was taking to a friend and referenced an aphorism which I then duly attributed to everybody’s favourite German
cultural critic Friedrich Nietzsche. Except for the fact that I got it wrong, and missed out an important clause which
added very necessary context. And I completely misinterpreted it.</p>

<p>The lesson here is to not try and quote Nietzsche to your friends (or to anyone for that matter) because the only possible
outcome is that you end up looking like a pretentious twat.</p>
