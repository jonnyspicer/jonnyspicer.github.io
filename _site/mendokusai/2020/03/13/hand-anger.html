<meta name="description" content="Last night I was enjoying the recent uptick in player liquidity on Run It Once and was happily clicking buttons when a particular hand made me really angry. The nice thing about being a fun player is that now I can simply stop playing, take a step back and evaluate why exactly this hand irked me so much. The hand went as follows: Folds to hero in CO with AhKhQc8d, raises to 3.5bb BTN calls, blinds fold flop Ks8s2x hero bets 4.5bb, villain calls turn Ks8s2xAs pot 16.5bb, hero checks, villain bets 11bb, hero calls river Ks8s2xAs2x pot 38.5bb hero pots, villain calls and tables… … … … T663sssx. My first reaction is to inwardly chastise villain for making such a bad play - I think preflop is definitely -EV and every other street is at best breakeven. Why am I so angry? It’s a sense of entitlement, one of the ways ego manifests itself in poker, because he made a ‘bad’ play, he doesn’t deserve to win my money. But maybe he had a sick read on me, he felt he could outplay me in position despite having mediocre holdings, perhaps my large lead OTR was actually a lot more exploitable than I had thought. It’s also a spot where in reality I think I am making a lot of EV, just in this case I happened to lose actual money. Even after a couple of million hands of poker, those spots still hurt. I wonder how much my poker mental game is influenced by my mental health off the felt. If I needed less external validation, the kind I might get from winning money at poker and thus proving some kind of intellectual superiority, I can’t help but feel that these spots wouldn’t tilt me so much. The obvious sequitur is that I should work on my IRL mental game and then things will fall into place at the tables, but perhaps the reverse might also be true?" />

  <h1>Hand Anger</h1>

  <p>
    13 Mar 2020
    
    
  </p>

  <p>Last night I was enjoying the recent uptick in player liquidity on Run It Once and was happily clicking buttons when a particular hand made me really <em>angry</em>. The nice thing about
being a fun player is that now I can simply stop playing, take a step back and evaluate why exactly this hand irked me so much.</p>

<p>The hand went as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Folds to hero in CO with AhKhQc8d, raises to 3.5bb</li>
  <li>BTN calls, blinds fold</li>
  <li>flop Ks8s2x hero bets 4.5bb, villain calls</li>
  <li>turn Ks8s2xAs pot 16.5bb, hero checks, villain bets 11bb, hero calls</li>
  <li>river Ks8s2xAs2x pot 38.5bb hero pots, villain calls and tables…</li>
</ul>

<p>…</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>T663sssx.</p>

<p>My first reaction is to inwardly chastise villain for making such a bad play - I think preflop is definitely -EV and every other street is at best breakeven. Why am I so angry?

where in reality I think I am making a lot of EV, just in this case I happened to lose actual money. Even after a couple of million hands of poker, those spots still hurt.</p>

thus proving some kind of intellectual superiority, I can’t help but feel that these spots wouldn’t tilt me so much. The obvious <em>sequitur</em> is that I should work on my IRL
mental game and then things will fall into place at the tables, but perhaps the reverse might also be true?</p>
