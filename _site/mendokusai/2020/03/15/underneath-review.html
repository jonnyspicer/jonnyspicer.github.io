<meta name="description" content="On Friday Code Orange’s new record ‘Underneath’ dropped, their third under their present moniker and the followup to their 2017 critically-acclaimed ‘Forever’.

The blend their eclectic influences with their signature sound and a healthy dose of experimentation leaving an album that both sounds unique and takes a lot of risks - which all pay off in spades. The record is a triumph, a successful evolution of the bands’ sound which forges into new artistic ground without alienating their own fans, a feat that few musicians seem to achieve these days (it reminds me a lot of how I feel like Slipknot’s post All Hope Is Gone discography should sound). Already a very serious contender for album of the year, well worth a listen if you like distorted guitars, double kick bass drums and screaming. 8.5/10." />

  <p>On Friday Code Orange’s new record ‘Underneath’ dropped, their third under their present moniker and the followup to
their 2017 critically-acclaimed ‘Forever’. The band’s hardcore punk roots have gradually bled into heavier and heavier
territory, and <em>Underneath</em> is fairly undeniably a metalcore record. The new album makes greater use of Reba Myers’
impressive clean vocals while still showcasing that Jami Morgan has put a lot of work into his own growls. The blend
their eclectic influences with their signature sound and a healthy dose of experimentation leaving an album that both
sounds unique and takes a lot of risks - which all pay off in spades. The record is a triumph, a successful evolution
of the bands’ sound which forges into new artistic ground without alienating their own fans, a feat that few musicians
seem to achieve these days (it reminds me a lot of how I feel like Slipknot’s post <em>All Hope Is Gone</em> discography should
sound).</p>

<p>Already a very serious contender for album of the year, well worth a listen if you like distorted guitars, double kick
bass drums and screaming. 8.5/10.</p>
