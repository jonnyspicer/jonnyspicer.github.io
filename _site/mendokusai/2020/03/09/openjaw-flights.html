  <p>Extracting maximum value from flights seems to be something of a dark art, and there is a whole world
of airmiles, alliances and error fares to try and wrap one’s head around. Airfare pricing in general
still seems completely nonsenical to me, but today I discovered the existence of so-caled “open-jaw” 
flights, which could prove to be an important piece of the affordable travel puzzle. For example, a
direct flight from Edinburgh to NYC with Delta, one way - £1700. But a multi-city roundtrip, with
the return flight from Las Vegas to London? £500 for both flights. I assume they make the one-way
prices ridiculous to incentivise flying both ways on the same carrier, but still, 3.5x seems nuts.</p>

<p>I’m glad I’ve learned about this one small machination of the aviation industry. As I dive deeper
down the rabbit hole, I’m sure I’ll provide more details of GTO flying.</p>
