He is everything I think a modern man should be; kind, attentive, remarkably patient and wholly unpretentious despite being an intellectual juggernaut. When he talks about social structure, about media or addiction, about a framework within which to live one’s life, his ability to think deeply on a subject becomes wondrously apparent, and he seems to cut through every single layer of assumption and bias a mere mortal might have with an almostly unsettling sense of perception and clarity. There is no doubt in my mind that he was a genius, a unique talent, one of an exceptional few who managed to see through society’s veil and understand the true nature of the modern human reality." />

  <p>The more of Infinite Jest I read, and the more interviews and clips of David Foster Wallace that I listen to and watch, the more in awe I am of him. Having <a href="https://jonnyspicer.com/tartarus/2020/03/29/pretending-ii" target="_blank">recently mused</a> about both male role models and what kind of man I might like to be, DFW is a serious contender for the former and a
very plausible template for the latter. He is everything I think a modern man should be; kind, attentive, remarkably patient and wholly unpretentious despite being an intellectual juggernaut.
When he talks about social structure, about media or addiction, about a framework within which to live one’s life, his ability to think deeply on a subject becomes wondrously apparent, and he
seems to cut through every single layer of assumption and bias a mere mortal might have with an almostly unsettling sense of perception and clarity. There is no doubt in my mind that he was
a genius, a unique talent, one of an exceptional few who managed to see through society’s veil and understand the true nature of the modern human reality.</p>

<p>When I think about not being <em>insert-adjective-here</em>-enough, DFW is around the arbitrary thresholds which I have set myself. I want to be that kind, that articulate, that patient, that
smart. Even before I started learning about him and his works, all the qualities he has are qualities I aspired to, moreover often qualities I thought I <em>should</em> have. But the deeper down the
rabbit hole I go, the more painful it becomes - despite, in my eyes, being more in touch with reality and having a better grasp on a meaningful life than anyone else I can think of, Wallace
still chose to end his.</p>

<p>I would be lying if I said there wasn’t part of me that hoped Infinite Jest might give me some clue as to the answer for some Question, inarticulated yet still deserving of a capital letter. I
even <a href="/mendokusai/2020/02/13/infinite-jest-for-the-wrong-reasons" target="_blank">wrote previously</a> that I was anticipating some kind of spiritual experience, with the implication that by
the end, I would achieve some slice of enlightenment. DFW seems to have walked all the way down the path which I would’ve thought had the solutions; he sat under the Bodhi tree for 49 days,
but he found himself as mortal and in pain as the rest of us.</p>

<p>If it didn’t work out for him, perhaps I need to seriously consider walking a different path myself.</p>
