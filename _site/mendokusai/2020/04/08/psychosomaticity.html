  <p>When I get stressed, the skin on my face gets really dry, and it gets red and blotchy and kinda gross. Previously I have
hated it, because it always feels like salt in the wound - not only are you having a bad time, but you look dumb while
doing it now too. But there is something pretty neat about psychosomaticity; you can’t rationalise it away. As much as
you want to tell yourself you’re fine, you’ll get some rest at the weekend, you’ll do this next little bit and then
call it a night etc etc, if your is telling a different story then you kinda have to listen.</p>

<p>On that note, I am <em>determined</em> to watch a bunch of films this weekend and severely stymie myself from writing any code.</p>
