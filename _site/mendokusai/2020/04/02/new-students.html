  <p>The whole world is looking for new indoor activities with which to amuse themselves, and it seems a lot of people are
turning to chess - just take a quick look at chess.com’s <a href="https://www.chess.com/blog/erik/chess-com-during-this-global-stay-home-moment" target="_blank">server load</a>
if you don’t believe me. It seems some of these new students are looking for masters and a couple of my friends have
even reached out to me for lessons (not that I am a master, especially not so in the strict chess sense).</p>

<p>Given that I’m used to playing almost exclusively with players &gt; 2x my age, it’ll be quite nice to be able to talk
about the game with people who are in the same place in life as me, and it’ll be doubly good to have my ego stroked
as I do my best to impart unto them what little chess wisdom I’ve gleaned over the years.</p>
