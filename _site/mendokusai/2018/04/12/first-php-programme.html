  <h1>First PHP programme!</h1>

  <span >Today I wrote a cute little script in PHP, essentially the first non-webpage coding I have done. With a bit of tweaking it could be a plugin for a website. The first part of the script is essentially for testing the second part - it asks the user to type in a password, then asks if they would like to enter another. Each password the user enters is encrypted and stored in an array in hashed form. Once the user stops entering new passwords, the second part of the script prompts the user for a password, and then checks it against the hashed array. If it's a valid password, the user gets a redirect message and then the programme exits (seeing as it just runs in CLI, there is nothing to redirect to). If the password is incorrect, the user is prompted to try again, and if they enter three incorrect passwords, they get locked out, with a message to try again later.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I've never really made anything I am especially proud of, but this script might be something of which I am.</span>
