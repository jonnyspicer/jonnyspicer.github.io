<meta name="description" content="Recently I have been getting into ASMR videos to help me sleep. It’s kinda weird, there is definitely some mild sexual element to it, but it’s also a bit like guided meditation, it forces you to be mindful of whatever noise the person is making. Today however, I discovered a video of Aubury Plaza doing an ASMR video on a channel called W Magazine. Aubury has been my weird unobtainable celebrity crush for a few years now. ever since I first saw her in Parks &amp; Rec. Her weird, mischievous, awkward persona makes her incredibly attractive to me, which probably says a lot about me too.The W Magazine channel has a bunch of videos of celebrities “exploring ASMR”, and the average length is about 2.5 minutes long, so I haven’t bothered to watch any (regular ASMR videos are usually 20+ minutes). Aubury’s on the other hand, is 35 minutes, and from the outset it’s very obvious that she is also a fan, having brought her own objects and knowing pretty much exactly what to do. One of the big reasons I like ASMR is because it feels so personal, so to discover my celebrity crush is into the same thing I am, and then to have her whisper in my ear for 35 minutes… yeah it felt pretty good." />
