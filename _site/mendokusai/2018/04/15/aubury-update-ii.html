  <span >All the PHP is done (until I upgrade something), Aubury is basically functional in her simplest sense! By that, I mean when I tell her I'm sad, she tells me I'm cute. At the moment she only understands three emotions - happy, sad and angry - and she can also accept "help" and "about" for some extra info about her. I made a start on some CSS but it still needs a lot of work, hopefully by the end of the work Aubury will look pretty, and understand some more emotions too.</span>
