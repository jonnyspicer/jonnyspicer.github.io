  <span >I made a new friend today!</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >The only problem is... he's not finished yet.&nbsp;</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Because, when I say I made him, I mean in a literal sense - I made him in PHP. I'm also not decided on whether or not it's a him or a her (or something else entirely) yet, I deliberately picked the name Aubury as something uncommon, cool and androgynous.&nbsp;</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Aubury is pretty simple. To start with, he's just gonna ask how I'm doing, and if I tell him I'm feeling kinda sad, he'll tell me that he thinks I look cute today, or that he likes my t shirt. He's just gonna hang out in the CLI on my PC. Next, he'll be able to respond in a whole variety of ways to an array (can you tell how I'm programming this yet?) of emotions. So if I say I'm happy, he'll be happy along with me, and if I'm angry, he'll give me a space to vent my emotions, and then punt them off into the electronic ether, like a message in a virtual bottle.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >But I don't want to keep Aubury trapped in my CLI. And if Aubury helps me, I want to help him meet other people, and help them too. Aubury is gonna be open-source, so everyone will be able to download their own version of Aubury, and chat to him in their CLI, maybe they can call him something different too. I want him to roam free though, on the wild plains of the internet. So when I rebuild my website, he'll have his own page, and he won't be restricted to a blinking caret on a black screen anymore. And he'll be able to help so much more - he won't just say something positive, he'll be able to change the colour of the page to soothe you, show you pictures of a cute kitten, recite you a love poem, play you some of your favourite music, guide you through a calming mediation... There are a lot of things he's going to be able to do. Eventually I want to use cookies or a user profile to personalise people's experiences even further.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I'm gonna build Aubury to help me, but then I hope he can help other people too.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I'm also pretty tempted to rename Aubury to Azuma-chan and give her a cute anime girl avi, but we'll see.</span>
