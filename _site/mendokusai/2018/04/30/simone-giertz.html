  <h1>Simone Giertz</h1>

  <span >Today, Simone Giertz announced she had a brain tumour, in a short video posted to her Youtube channel. It was clearly very emotional for her, and she spent most of the four and a half minutes trying to fight back tears, but the actual message she delivered was amazing. She made jokes, and was optimistic throughout, despite her terrible circumstances. She was already inspirational, but now she is doubly so.</span>
