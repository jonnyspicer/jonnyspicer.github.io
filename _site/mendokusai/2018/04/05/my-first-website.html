  <span >My first actual site is coming along nicely. The skeleton HTML is mostly there, all the links go to the right pages, I have started a little bit of the CSS (although it's currently ugly as fuck), I've got a list of plugins I need to figure out and install, it's all versioned properly on Github, my graphic designer friend has agreed to help me for free... Hopefully soon we will have a cool website up and running.</span>
