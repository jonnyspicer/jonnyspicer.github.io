  <h1>Death Grips</h1>

  <span >Death Grips seem to be the most talked about musicians on the internet. Divisive, controversial and experimental, I am sort of embarrassed I haven't listened to them sooner, given that I am always looking for art that is unusual or pushing boundaries, rather than necessarily beautiful. This week I finally got round to listening to their breakout album, The Money Store, and it is a banger. Not sure if it is quite life changing, perhaps after a few more listens, but it is certainly damn good.</span>
