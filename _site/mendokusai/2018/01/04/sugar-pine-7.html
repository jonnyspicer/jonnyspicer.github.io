  It's interesting how involved I (and presumably other people) can get involved in shows, or in this case, Youtube shows with weird meta concepts. Sugar Pine 7 is a bizarre pseudo-vlog where it's never obvious what is scripted and what is improvised, or even when the characters are doing a bit or being real. Or even whether or not they are characters or their real selves. It is definitely genius.<br /><br />In one way, it is just a shitty Youtube show. But the people are involved are smart and inspiring, and watching the show makes me happier than it probably should. Is that a bad thing?
