<meta name="description" content="Oh man Eleague has been so good today. Counterstrike has one of the highest skillcaps of any major esports title and in the semi finals it was really on show, with two of the best aimers in the world facing off against each other on the semi finals, producing shots that shouldn’t even be possible. In the second semi the NA underdogs are facing the Brazilian multiple major winners. The NA team, Cloud9, is insanely talented but never seem to be able to get their teamwork together sufficiently in order to make a deep run in a tournament, but on home soil perhaps this will be their time to shine." />
