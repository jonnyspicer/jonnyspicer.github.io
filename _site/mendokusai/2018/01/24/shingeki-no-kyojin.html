  <h1>Shingeki no Kyojin</h1>

  <span >Season 3 of Shingeki no Kyojin was announced to be airing in July of this year and I can't remember the last time I was this excited about something. I think season 2 of SnK was probably my favourite piece of art/culture in any medium, better than my favourite film, book, TV show or album. It's the most compelling thing I've ever consumed and I cannot wait to find out how the next chapter in the story unfolds.</span>
