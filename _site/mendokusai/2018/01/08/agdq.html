  <span >I have been looking forward to Awesome Games Done Quick 2018 for a few months now, planning on taking time out of my schedule since then to watch as much of it as I could, as I love the event every year. But so far this year... it just doesn't feel the same. It's really a mixture of things as to why, but I feel disappointed. I wonder if I am in the wrong, if they are, or neither of us are.</span>
