  <h1>The Room</h1>

  <span >Last night I watched the infamous film, "The Room" with Lisa, which is already pretty funny given two of the protagonists of the film are named Johnny and Lisa themselves. We decided to watch it after hearing it described as the worst film of all time... and it really was. I am not any kind of film critic and won't even pretend to know much about or even watch many films, but even I can confidently say, the acting is bad, the writing is bad, the camerawork is bad, the effects are bad, the sound... is not too bad.&nbsp;</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Nothing in the film makes any sense. The plot is incoherent and impossible to follow, but oftentimes that is due to its lack of existence. Tommy Wiseau's acting performance would undoubtedly be put to shame by my elementary school leavers' play. The dialogue just doesn't make sense a lot of the time. There are multiple sex scenes (including one which is literally pasted in, I had to double check that was actually intended and someone on the internet wasn't just messing with me) in the film, and I am fairly sure no two human beings have ever copulated in the way portrayed by The Room. Most characters have no introduction or back story, instead turning up randomly in scenes and leaving the audience with more questions than answers once they leave. Like I said I am no film critic, so I don't think I can really convey quite how objectively awful this film is, the only way to really experience that would be to watch it for yourself, but why would you watch it for yourself?</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Well.... it was a lot of fun, and I want to see it again. I laughed a lot, often at the absurdity of it. There was definitely an element of morbid curiosity, I remember thinking after the first 10 minutes "this is so bad, how can there be 100 minutes of this?" but lo and behold, there was. I felt a genuine emotional connection with Johnny by the end of it, possibly in some part because of his name, but also because I knew he wrote and directed this monstrosity, and it was obvious that despite it being truly abysmal, he was trying really hard. In a way it was stimulating, trying to work out what the fuck was actually happening, searching for meaning when in reality I don't think there was one. Even now I am trying to justify to myself the fact that I enjoyed it - maybe it unintentionally parodied movies masterfully, and was a biting work of accidental satire?</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I really don't know, but it is definitely the best worst film I've ever seen, so I heartily recommend it.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><br />
