<meta name="description" content="I think I have already written a couple of times about how much esports has grown since I started following it, but I feel like writing about it again.This weekend the LCS starts again, and OWL is in its 2nd week, meaning I get to spent my whole weekend watching esports’ first two attempts at creating franchised leagues. There will be millions of viewers and millions of dollars involved, and that’s just in those two leagues, there is a $400k Dota tournament this weekend two and likely a handful of other midsized events I don’t know of. I think in 20 years time when the generation that first fell in love with esports has all had kids, it really could rival the NBA or the NFL. It feels kinda nice to be able to say I was an esports hipster and that I liked it before it was cool. " />
