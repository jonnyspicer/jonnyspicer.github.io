  <span >A while ago I had a somewhat impassioned debate with someone over a subject sensitive to both of us. We had an interesting discourse that lasted quite a while but was reasonably constructive I think. We also had fairly polar viewpoints, and at the time I don't think either of us really changed our views as a direct result of the conversation. Things ended up getting pretty intense, and eventually, there were tears.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >In the last two days, I have realised I might have been wrong. Fuck.</span>
