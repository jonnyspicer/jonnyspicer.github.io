  <span >Today I made a start on another new creative project, something I am excited about. This is my third such thing to fill my near-infinite amount of time.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Firstly I am gonna learn some emo songs on bass and how to sing them, to play along with my brother on guitar.... drummers wanted.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Second is creative horror writing, still in the planning phase. Have a few ideas and it is slowly coming together, think it is going to likely end up being novella type length, but might be hyper trash.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Thirdly is the new one today, a Youtube channel featuring Old School Runescape videos. I have some good ideas for videos/series etc, and I think it will be fun to improve my video editing skills. I fully expect to get no views, but I think I can still produce something I am proud of, without anyone watching. I recorded my first couple of clips today and am pretty happy with how they turned out, although it will be at least a week until my first video is out I think.</span>
