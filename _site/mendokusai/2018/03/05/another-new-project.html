<meta name="description" content="Today I made a start on another new creative project, something I am excited about. This is my third such thing to fill my near-infinite amount of time.Firstly I am gonna learn some emo songs on bass and how to sing them, to play along with my brother on guitar…. drummers wanted.Second is creative horror writing, still in the planning phase. Have a few ideas and it is slowly coming together, think it is going to likely end up being novella type length, but might be hyper trash.Thirdly is the new one today, a Youtube channel featuring Old School Runescape videos. I have some good ideas for videos/series etc, and I think it will be fun to improve my video editing skills. I fully expect to get no views, but I think I can still produce something I am proud of, without anyone watching. I recorded my first couple of clips today and am pretty happy with how they turned out, although it will be at least a week until my first video is out I think." />
