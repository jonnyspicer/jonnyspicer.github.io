  <span >Life is such a hilarious, ridiculous, frustrating, tumultuous experience. Whether or not I am actually enjoying said experience is still TBD.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >Today I got offered a job interview from a company that has already offered me a job once, and a former flame who I thought had a boyfriend sent me some snaps that, well, suggested she no longer has a boyfriend.
