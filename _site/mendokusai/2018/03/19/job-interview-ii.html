  <span >Today was the first time I have worn a suit in the last 2 and a bit years, funnily enough the last time was when the same company I interviewed at today previously offered me a job.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I kinda hate people in suits, but wearing one also made me feel weirdly confident.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >I feel like the interview went well, he seemed positive overall, but I don't want to get my hopes up. I'll find out on Monday.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><br />
