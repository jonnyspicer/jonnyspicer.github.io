  <span >Going through the various stages of sleep deprivation today has been. To start with I was fine, albeit sluggish. Then I got a little anxious, then irritable, then that irritability almost grew into moments of genuine anger. Then the tiredness <i>really</i>&nbsp;set in and I could barely stay awake on my feet, and I started finding everything hilarious and couldn't stop laughing. Right now I feel wide awake, which sucks because I am about to go to bed. I've been awake for 38 hours in a row now, my alarm is set for 8 hours time, gl me.</span>
