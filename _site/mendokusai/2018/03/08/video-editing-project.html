<meta name="description" content="Everything is finally set to record all the clips for the first video I want to make and upload… and I’m too sick to do commentary, fml. I am hoping to change my sleep schedule up a bit though and start sleeping 10pm-6am which I think will help me be more productive when it comes to life in general but especially video creation because I will have more waking hours with a good internet connection. I should still be on track to get a video up by Saturday morning though, if I get all the clips I need tomorrow morning, I should be able to get it edited in the afternoon/evening and uploaded overnight. Too tired/sick to really think of anything meaningful to blog about, I’m off to sleep for 12 hours, bai." />
