  Today Charlie played me a few riffs and a baseline for an original song, and we talked a little about structure, style and recording options. We’re going to try and make it some kind of “studio” project, with studio in inverted commas because our recording space will mostly likely be our parents attic. He’s going to play drums and guitar and I’m going to play bass and, uh, sing. I can’t sing, but neither can any vocalist in an emo band, so perhaps that is a good thing. There are two outstanding problems, outside of practicalities of trying to record instruments, make some kind of attempt at mixing and mastering a song, etc. Firstly, we don’t have a name, although I think emo bands are somewhat easy to name as they follow something of a pattern. Secondly, I have to write all the lyrics for a song, Charlie has said he doesn’t want to do any of it. I have absolutely no idea how I’m going to write a song without hating myself, but I guess I’m gonna give it a go.
