  Programming is such a bizarre series of ups and downs. One moment I
  have crippling imposter syndrome - I feel like I don't deserve the job
  I have at all, and feel like I should quit to save my boss the trouble
  of realising how awful I am and firing me. But the next, I have written
  a function which has a little complexity, is decently efficient, and I
  worked hard on - I'm proud of it, and proud of myself by proxy.
</p>
<p>
  Like everything else in life, this process is pretty exhausting. I am
  na誰vely hoping that it will get better as I get better at programming -
  but I know it won't. Oh well.
