<meta name="description" content="Today I finally got round to rebuilding my main site, where this blog will be hosted in the (near) future. It has been a long time-coming, and I am glad I finally made a start - hopefully I can smash it out in a couple of weeks, although this is probably naive.I decided to move the site from Wordpress to Github Pages, and in doing so decided I was gonna give Jekyll a go instead of using a CMS. Installing Jekyll meant installing Ruby on my Windows machine, which I was not excited about. To start with, it was relatively easy, until I tried to install some Jekyll plugins, at which point it seems like the rubygems.org servers had a mare and timed out repeatedly. After trying ~10x, I finally managed to install the gems I was after, but it seems like I am definitely not gonna be updating them anytime soon. The skeleton of the site is vaguely set up - the git repo is initialised, I’ve got the sass structure sorted, I’ve got a config file working, the main pages and includes are all there, waiting to be populated with that sweet, juicy content. I’m still not 100% sure what I think about Jekyll overall and whether or not it’s preferable to a CMS, but I am super excited to try and build a very stripped back blog, potentially with no JS, and a very minimal design. " />
