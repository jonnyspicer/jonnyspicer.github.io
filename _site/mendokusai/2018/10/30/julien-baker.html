  In my recent quest for sad songs, I have rediscovered Julien Baker, affectionately
  known to her fans as the Sad Queen. She is definitely worth of that moniker,
  her music is haunting and sombre, but with a purity and beauty that make it
  more than worth listening to.
</p>
<p>
  She has a great <a href="https://youtu.be/GiNPcLwSeME" rel="noreferrer">set on KEXP,</a> 10/10 heartily recommending.
