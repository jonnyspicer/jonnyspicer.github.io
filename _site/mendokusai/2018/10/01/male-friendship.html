Everything is very “banterous”, superficial and usually about beer, babes and (foot)ball - for most men anyway. Even for those of us fedora-sporting gentlemen who prefer to converse about the finer things in life, like video games and anime tiddies, we still don’t talk about our feelings too much. But every so often, real life happens, and men have to talk about their feelings to one another. They have to be raw and open and vulnerable, and they are usually terrified, but it can produce the most beautiful moments.I had one of those moments today. It was pretty rad." />
