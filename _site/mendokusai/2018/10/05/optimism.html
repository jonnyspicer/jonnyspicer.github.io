I still think there is an objective argument that society is trash, and that is a good reason to feel depressed, but it seems my main strategy for dealing with that right now is just to, uh, try not to think about it. Just like I&#39;m not thinking about a big pink elephant right now. Fuck.I&#39;m trying to think of things to be optimistic about. The main thing I can think of right now is that tech is getting more advanced, and there is some non-zero amount of people out there trying to use its new capabilities to do good. Solid is a pretty good example. I plan on setting up an IPFS gateway this weekend. Pen testers are still creative, thorough geniuses. Maybe life isn&#39;t so bad." />

  I'm not very good at noticing the good things in life, especially given the way I fixate on the bad. I still think there is an objective argument that society is trash, and that is a good reason to feel depressed, but it seems my main strategy for dealing with that right now is just to, uh, try not to think about it. Just like I'm not thinking about a big pink elephant right now. Fuck.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of things to be optimistic about. The main thing I can think of right now is that tech is getting more advanced, and there is some non-zero amount of people out there trying to use its new capabilities to do good. <a href="https://solid.inrupt.com/">Solid </a>is a pretty good example. I plan on setting up an <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> gateway this weekend. Pen testers are still <a href="https://www.martinvigo.com/googlemeetroulette/">creative, thorough geniuses</a>. Maybe life isn't so bad.
