  People talk a lot these days about dealing with depression, anxiety, and other
  mental health problems in a very micro sense. If you are feeling particularly low
  one evening, reach out to a friend and tell them how you feel. If you're
  especially anxious about something, try mindfulness meditation for 15 minutes
  and focus only on your breath.
</p>
<p>
  People talk a lot less about what to do when you feel ground down over months,
  years, decades by your mental illness. It can be relentless, and the strategies
  above can feel like they no longer work, or that they will only postpone the
  inevitable return of the black cloud.

  I don't really know where I'm going with this. I'm not really sure what the
  right strategy is, or what big change needs to take place to break the cycle.
