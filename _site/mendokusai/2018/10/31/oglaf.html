<meta name="description" content="I often worry I am too open on this blog. This post, doubly so. I&#39;ve been having a rough time lately, but one of the things that has been cheering me up lately is... OGLAF. Is it a webcomic? Kinda. Is it porn? Well, it is certainly pornographic in parts at least, so I guess... maybe. Am I recommending you porn? I hope not. It&#39;s funny, in a slightly outrageous way. It just also happens to have a lot of genitals in it too. If you can suspend judgment and read it with an open mind... I think it is pretty good." />

  I often worry I am too open on this blog. This post, doubly so.

  I've been having a rough time lately, but one of the things that has been
  cheering me up lately is... <a href="https://oglaf.com" rel="noreferrer">OGLAF.</a>
  Is it a webcomic? Kinda. Is it porn? Well, it is certainly <i>pornographic</i> in
  parts at least, so I guess... maybe.
</p>
<p>
  Am I recommending you porn? I hope not.
</p>
<p>
  It's funny, in a slightly outrageous way. It just also happens to have a lot of
  genitals in it too. If you can suspend judgment and read it with an open mind...
  I think it is pretty good.
