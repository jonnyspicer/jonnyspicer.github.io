  <h1>Things that give me hope</h1>

  <p>
  Today I started a new Trello list, one that I'm excited about. It's
  titled "Things that give me hope". It sounds a little intense, implying
  that I have very little hope outside of these few things, but given
  the current social climate, can you really blame me? I'm sure I will share
  more of the list in the future, but here is what I have so far;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://thecorrespondent.com" rel="noreferrer">The Correspondent</a>
    - a new way of thinking about news journalism, with less corporate greed and
    more honesty and transparency. The English version is not yet live,
    but I am excited about it nonetheless, and I hope it lives up to its
    not unsubstantial promises.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://80000hours.org" rel="noreferrer">80000 Hours</a> -
    research and evidence based career advice for people who want to
    have more job satisfaction and change the world for the better in
    the process.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://opensource.org" rel="noreferrer">Open Source</a> -
    I have linked to the Open Source Initiative page, but OS is far more
    than that, it is a movement, and something that gives me a lot of hope
    in general. The fact that cyber-charity is such a big deal, and
    "donating" time and effort to it has very tangible career benefits,
    is one of the great advantages the computing industry has over others.
  </li>
</ul>
