  This is the first daily post which is going to be uploaded to this new
  Jekyll site on the same day it was published! The URL is currently
  jonnyspicer.github.io but assuming I get everything finished by the
  end of the weekend, I'll swap the domain over to jonnyspicer.com -
  an exciting time. It has taken a long time for me to even start this project
  and in the end, it didn't even require that many hours, &lt;20 so far,
  including having to learn Jekyll.

  Overall I am pretty happy, I like the minimal look, Jekyll has not been
  painless but it hasn't been excruciating either. There is a bit more
  effort involed in actually generating a blog post then there would be
  with a CMS, as evidenced by the fact I am writing this in my text editor
  - there's no wysiwyg to catch any embarrassing spelling mistakes. I also
  have to manually generate the post file with a specific date/name convention
  but after the site is complete I'll write a script to do that for me.
