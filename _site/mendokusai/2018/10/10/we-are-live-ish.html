  This is the first daily post which is going to be uploaded to this new
  Jekyll site on the same day it was published! The URL is currently
  jonnyspicer.github.io but assuming I get everything finished by the
  end of the weekend, I'll swap the domain over to jonnyspicer.com -
  an exciting time. It has taken a long time for me to even start this project
  and in the end, it didn't even require that many hours, &lt;20 so far,
  including having to learn Jekyll.
</p>
<p>
  Overall I am pretty happy, I like the minimal look, Jekyll has not been
  painless but it hasn't been excruciating either. There is a bit more
  effort involed in actually generating a blog post then there would be
  with a CMS, as evidenced by the fact I am writing this in my text editor
  - there's no wysiwyg to catch any embarrassing spelling mistakes. I also
  have to manually generate the post file with a specific date/name convention
  but after the site is complete I'll write a script to do that for me.
</p>
<p>
  Left to do as of 10th Oct 2018:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Set up home page with excerpts of last post in each blog;
    </li>
    <li>
      Change blog pages to just show last 5-10 posts for each blog,
      with dates;
    </li>
    <li>
      Add full archive pages, grouped by date;
    </li>
    <li>
      Review mobile/tablet styling (should just be changing font size...);
    </li>
    <li>
      Add CNAME file to repo;
    </li>
    <li>
      Change DNS for jonnyspicer.com to point to this site.
    </li>
  </ul>
