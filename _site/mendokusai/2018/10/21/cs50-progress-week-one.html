  <h1>CS50 Progress&#58; Week One</h1>

  <p>
    21 Oct 2018
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  I'm pleased to report that I just submitted a short programme in C for
  encrypting a string using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher"
  rel="noreferrer">Vigen√®re cipher,</a> and in so doing I have completed
  week one of CS50x.
</p>
<p>
  Despite it only being week one, there have been 3 problem sets thusfar,
  although admittedly the first one was just to make something fun in
  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="noreferrer">Scratch.</a> They have
  already been quite challenging, and I am under the impression that
  it is going to ramp up pretty quickly, so I am kinda scared. It is
  easy to procrastinate working on the problems too - I have found that
  when I feel like that, I have to force myself to write any kind of code,
  even if it is complete garbage, and then debug and refactor it all later.
</p>
<p>
  I'm only one week in, but it's been fun so far. I'm excited to watch
  some more of David Malan's epic lectures and get cracking on the next
  problem set tomorrow.
