  Today I am happy to announce I made my first open source contribution!
  Admittedly all I did was correct a handful of typos in the project docs,
  but nonetheless it felt good when my pull request got accepted. Even if
  this was not a contribution of any serious significance or skill, I am
  hoping that it marks the first of many, and will serve as a stepping stone
  towards making meaningful additions to bigger projects.

  first pull request. Check out <a href="https://davrodpin.github.io/mole/">
