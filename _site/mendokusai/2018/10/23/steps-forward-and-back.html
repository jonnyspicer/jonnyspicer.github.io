  Some days I feel like I am making progress, and other days everything feels
  overwhelming, and I am back at square one. If life were easy, by the
  same turn it would be boring, but it is hard to tell whether I am
  making net progress or not. It feels like I am at an equilibrium of sorts,
  and I'd rather not be.

  Today was a step back from yesterday. Tomorrow... who knows.
