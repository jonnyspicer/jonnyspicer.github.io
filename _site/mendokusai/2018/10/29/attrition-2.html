  They say, 'the feeling will come to pass' - it is allegedly comforting. Perhaps it
  actually <i>is</i> comforting, the first few times you hear it, and believe it.
  but the problem is not that the feeling will not pass. The problem is that once it
  has passed, it will return.
</p>
<p>
  I am not afraid that this feeling will never pass. But I am afraid that once it passes,
  it will never stop coming back, again and again and again and again.
