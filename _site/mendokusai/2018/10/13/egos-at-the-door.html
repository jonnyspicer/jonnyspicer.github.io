I even hooked up an old android phone to my PC and installed developer options by tapping the build number 7 times. I had no joy whatsoever. What. The. Fuck.

  Today was another perfect example of why having an ego and being
  a programmer seem completely incompatible. This site is built
  only really using HTML and CSS - admittedly there is some templating
  and preprocessing done with Sass/Liquid etc - but it should still
  be easy enough.
</p>
<p>
  I spent maybe two hours today staring at the mobile styling
  for this page. I had a regular desktop browser set to 375px
  wide, but everything was too small, and the DOM elements
  were telling me that there were bigger than they demonstrably were.
  <code>console.log(screen.width);</code> returned 375px - what we'd
  expect. <code>console.log(document.querySelector('body').screenWidth);</code>
  however, returned 980px, despite it clearly being visually
  less than the width of the device. I even hooked up an old
  android phone to my PC and <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options">
  installed developer options by tapping the build number 7 times.</a> I had no joy whatsoever.
  What. The. Fuck.
</p>
<p>
  Except not really what the fuck, because anyone who would so
  brazenly call themselves a web developer, as I have, would
  know that the first thing to check would be whether or not
  a meta value had been set for the viewport. I'm a clown.

  At least I am a clown who learned something, and I suspect
  this is the last time I make this mistake again - at the very
  least I hope it is the last time I waste nearly 2 hours trying
  to correct it. The relief when I could finally get media queries
  working correctly was palpable.
