  <h1>Beware of Dog II</h1>

  </p>

  <p>
  There is a dog I have heard barking for the past couple of years. I have grown
  incredibly scared of the sound the dog makes - far more scared than the Mexican
  chihuahua. Hearing it has given me full blown panic attacks, in a way that
  nothing else in my life does. It's definitely got worse over the years. I find
  it really hard to talk about how afraid I am of the noise, I'm deeply ashamed
  of it, because I know I shouldn't feel the way I do. I know that my fear is
  not grounded in reality, and that is alarming in of itself.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, last night I saw the dog. And once I did, I wasn't scared. In fact, it
  was kinda nice, it's a cute dog.
</p>
<p>
  I've been advised a lot recently to 'allow myself to feel my feelings' and other
  similar cookie fortunes. In the wake of last night I have certainly felt a lot of
  feelings today, and have done my best to embrace both the painful and the
  comfortable.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately I wouldn't hear the dog bark very often, so I wouldn't say that
  it was necessarily having a huge effect on my life, but it is definitely
  some of the strongest anxiety when I do. I am hopeful that if I can overcome
  my fear of the dog, I will be able to come anything else I struggle with.
  Wish me luck.
