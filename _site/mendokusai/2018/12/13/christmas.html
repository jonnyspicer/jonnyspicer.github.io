  I would not usually consider myself 'Christmassy'. I try to avoid being a
  complete Scrooge, but I have found it hard to get on board with Christmas
  for my adult life - probably because I obnoxiously love to hate anything popular.
  But today... I feel like a little of the Christmas spirit has come over me.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not entirely sure what it is. Maybe it's that I've got all my Christmas
  shopping sorted - a stressful endeavour, but now done with almost two
  weeks to spare. Maybe it's the feeling of being in a warm building, staving
  off the bitter cold outside, when it becomes tough not to feel all fuzzy on
  the inside. Maybe it's because this is the first Christmas I will get to spend
  with my brother in 5 years, and I'm genuinely excited about that.
</p>
<p>
  Or maybe it's just because I've been playing the Killing Floor Christmas event and
  I've had August Burns Red's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8HXKZwBBXQ" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  full 15 song Christmas metal album</a> on repeat all day, and it's wall to wall
  bangers. Either way - happy holidays everyone.
