<meta name="description" content="When I initially began writing on the internet a little over two years ago, I thought I was quite a good writer. A couple of hundred posts later, and I feel I have improved my writing a lot, and now I&#39;m an awful writer. The difference of course is that I have learned a lot more about the process of writing, and what constitutes doing it well, losing some amount of naïveté along the way. Now I see I was awful to begin with, but I also think I have since improved - I have found my voice. I write at least somewhat akin to how I speak and have developed something of my own style, although I occasionally break that when I am trying to write something funny. My vocabulary has expanded, the average length of my posts is going up, and I no longer see writing as a chore - I actually look forward to it! Despite writing here every day, I have a very healthy list of potential blog ideas (50+), and I&#39;m sure there are a myriad of topics I&#39;d like to talk about that aren&#39;t in the list. When I started Thoughts From Tartarus, it was intended as a purely selfish endeavour, something that was meant to be cathartic for me. I was not writing for anyone. When I started this blog, it was admittedly to win a bet, but given that precisely one person was actually reading the blog, the outcome became similarly self-centered. Posts were half letters to my friend, half journal entires about whatever was on my mind. I don&#39;t have any tracking or analytics on this iteration of the site, so I don&#39;t know for sure, but I strongly suspect that I still only have exactly one reader (hi Ted!). In the past month or so, I have noticed that I am actually a little proud of some of the pieces I write, even if they are written daily, often in less than an hour and with little to no editing. My newfound pride has left me a little confused - what was once an exercise undertaken by and large for me, by me, I would now like to share. There are many thoughts expressed in these posts I would like to share with my (other) friends, and perhaps there are a select few which I think even a total stranger might gain something from. If I were to try to promote the blog somehow, it feels like I would be betraying the original intentions I had when it was conceived, as if I am selling out (even though I would never monetise this and likely never introduce any kind of tracking). Saying to my friends &#39;hey, I write a blog every day, you should check it out!&#39; seems weird because I think it&#39;s arrogant to suggest that my blog is of sufficient quality that it is worth them spending some of their time on it every day, especially when it invariably isn&#39;t. Equally, it would make me feel uncomfortable to send my friends a link every time I published a post I thought they might enjoy, because I don&#39;t want to be sending them several links to my own work each month. I could also start a mailing list and do a monthly &#39;best of&#39; email, but then I would have to collect people&#39;s data which I inherently dislike the idea of. I think I&#39;m just going to ask my closest friends - the ones I would like to read this the most - what they think, including whether I should keep writing with a focus on it being solely for myself.

  <h1>The State of the Blog</h1>

  </p>

  <p>
  When I initially began writing on the internet a little over two years ago, I
  thought I was quite a good writer. A couple of hundred posts later, and I feel
  I have improved my writing a lot, and now I'm an awful writer.
</p>
<p>
  The difference of course is that I have learned a lot more about the process of
  writing, and what constitutes doing it well, losing some amount of naïveté
  along the way. Now I see I was awful to begin with, but I also think I have  since improved - I have found my voice.
  I write at least somewhat akin to how I speak and have developed something of my own style,
  although I occasionally break that when I am trying to write something funny.
  My vocabulary has expanded, the average length of my posts is going up, and I no
  longer see writing as a chore - I actually look forward to it! Despite writing here every
  day, I have a very healthy list of potential blog ideas (50+), and I'm sure there
  are a myriad of topics I'd like to talk about that aren't in the list.
</p>
<p>
  When I started Thoughts From Tartarus, it was intended as a purely selfish endeavour,
  something that was meant to be cathartic for me. I was not
  writing for anyone. When I started this blog, it was admittedly to win a bet, but
  given that precisely one person was actually reading the blog, the outcome became
  similarly self-centered. Posts were half letters to my friend, half journal entires about whatever
  was on my mind. I don't have any tracking or analytics on this iteration of the site,
  so I don't know for sure, but I strongly suspect that I still only have exactly one
  reader (hi Ted!). In the past month or so, I have noticed that I am actually a little proud
  of some of the pieces I write, even if they are written daily, often in
  less than an hour and with little to no editing.

  people's data which I inherently dislike the idea of.

  I think I'm just going to ask my closest friends - the ones I would like to read
  this the most - what they think, including whether I should keep writing with a
