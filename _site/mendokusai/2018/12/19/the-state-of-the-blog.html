When I started this blog, it was admittedly to win a bet, but given that precisely one person was actually reading the blog, the outcome became similarly self-centered. Posts were half letters to my friend, half journal entires about whatever was on my mind. I don&#39;t have any tracking or analytics on this iteration of the site, so I don&#39;t know for sure, but I strongly suspect that I still only have exactly one reader (hi Ted!). In the past month or so, I have noticed that I am actually a little proud of some of the pieces I write, even if they are written daily, often in less than an hour and with little to no editing. My newfound pride has left me a little confused - what was once an exercise undertaken by and large for me, by me, I would now like to share. There are many thoughts expressed in these posts I would like to share with my (other) friends, and perhaps there are a select few which I think even a total stranger might gain something from.

  When I initially began writing on the internet a little over two years ago, I
  thought I was quite a good writer. A couple of hundred posts later, and I feel
  I have improved my writing a lot, and now I'm an awful writer.
</p>
<p>
  The difference of course is that I have learned a lot more about the process of
  writing, and what constitutes doing it well, losing some amount of naïveté
  along the way. Now I see I was awful to begin with, but I also think I have  since improved - I have found my voice.
  I write at least somewhat akin to how I speak and have developed something of my own style,
  although I occasionally break that when I am trying to write something funny.
  My vocabulary has expanded, the average length of my posts is going up, and I no
  longer see writing as a chore - I actually look forward to it! Despite writing here every
  day, I have a very healthy list of potential blog ideas (50+), and I'm sure there
  are a myriad of topics I'd like to talk about that aren't in the list.
</p>
<p>
  When I started Thoughts From Tartarus, it was intended as a purely selfish endeavour,
  something that was meant to be cathartic for me. I was not
  writing for anyone. When I started this blog, it was admittedly to win a bet, but
  given that precisely one person was actually reading the blog, the outcome became
  similarly self-centered. Posts were half letters to my friend, half journal entires about whatever
  was on my mind. I don't have any tracking or analytics on this iteration of the site,
  so I don't know for sure, but I strongly suspect that I still only have exactly one

  people's data which I inherently dislike the idea of.
