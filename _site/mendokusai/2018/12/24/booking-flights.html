  <h1>Booking Flights</h1>

  <p>
    24 Dec 2018
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  A year ago today, on the brink of a spectular mental breakdown, I booked a
  (very expensive) transatlantic flight for the next day, and spent 10 hours on
  Christmas tipsy and sleep deprived 35000ft above the big blue ocean. I was a bit
  of a mess to the say the least.
</p>
<p>
  This year I am booking more flights, and I'm still a mess, but not quite as bad
  as last time. They're for a trip to go see one of my favourite bands and stay
  with one of my oldest friends next month, and I know it's going to make me
  very happy. I haven't solved any of the problems that I felt I was facing this
  time last year, but I think I have grown a little as a person, and I've got some
  ideas about how I'm going to figure my shit out.
</p>
<p>
  Merry Christmas y'all ✌️
