  If there's one thing that Chicago Joey taught me, it's <s>how to talk to women</s>
  <s>that you should never fold to 3bets in PLO</s> the value of conversation.
</p>
<p>
  Today, a particularly wise friend of mine asked if my anxiety had ever served me
  well. I'd never really considered it before, but the answer was yes - there had
  been times when avoiding people, or heavily censoring my own thoughts and feelings
  had been the appropriate response to the situation I was in. The problem is that
  now I have learned this behaviour, its lingering presence in my psyche is no
  longer useful to me, and it has dug its quivering, sweaty heels in, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
  Having a simple, honest conversation with someone I respected gave me this gem
  of pure clarity and insight into my own life, a conclusion that I may never
  have arrived at on my own. People are wonderful, thank you Joey.
