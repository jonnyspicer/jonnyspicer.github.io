<meta name="description" content="Today I finally got around to reading some of Aaron Swartz&#39;s blog. Having been a reddit user for the last 7 or 8 years, I was aware of him as a cofounder of the site and through that as an activist. I remember thinking that what he did was cool, mostly because at the time I didn&#39;t see pirating music as anything more than &#39;free stuff!&#39;, so I admired his quest for an open internet. It was on reddit I remember reading that he had committed suicide in 2013, but at the time I didn&#39;t understand quite how much of a loss to the tech community it was. He accomplished so much at such a young age - if cirumstances had been different and he had continued working, I believe the whole internet could look different today. His vision was that the web would allow anyone free access to the entire repository of human knowledge, and he went to remarkable lengths to pursue that goal. He saw so much good in what the internet was, and what it could be, and reflecting on that today is difficult. My own reservations about the internet are growing daily, despite having spent my adult life espousing its value. I don&#39;t think I am alone either - I get the impression that both web veterans and technophobes alike are becoming increasingly wary of the ominously vague &#39;dangers of the internet&#39;. Aaron&#39;s writing has a remarkable clarity of thought, which makes it very enjoyable to read. His arguments seem simultaneously simple and compelling. Again, it&#39;s difficult to accept how young he was when he wrote some of his posts - they seem as if he has devoted a lifetime to meditating on the topics he speaks about. My favourites are I Hate the News and the Raw Nerve series. Rest in peace Aaron. I hope that one day I can grow up to be like you." />

  <p>
  Today I finally got around to reading some of <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  Aaron Swartz's blog.</a> Having been a reddit user for the last 7 or 8 years,
  I was aware of him as a cofounder of the site and through that as an activist. I
  remember thinking that what he did was cool, mostly because at the time I didn't
  see pirating music as anything more than 'free stuff!', so I admired his quest
  for an open internet.
</p>
<p>
  It was on reddit I remember reading that he had committed suicide in 2013, but at the
  time I didn't understand quite how much of a loss to the tech community it was.
  He accomplished so much at such a young age - if cirumstances had been different
  and he had continued working, I believe the whole internet could look different
  today. His vision was that the web would allow anyone free access to the entire
  repository of human knowledge, and he went to remarkable lengths to pursue that
  goal. He saw so much good in what the internet was, and what it could be, and
  reflecting on that today is difficult. My own reservations about the internet
  are growing daily, despite having spent my adult life espousing its value. I don't think I
  am alone either - I get the impression that both web veterans and technophobes
  alike are becoming increasingly wary of the ominously vague 'dangers of the internet'.
</p>
<p>
  Aaron's writing has a remarkable clarity of thought, which makes it very
  enjoyable to read. His arguments seem simultaneously simple and compelling.
  Again, it's difficult to accept how young he was when he wrote some of his posts
  - they seem as if he has devoted a lifetime to meditating on the topics he
  speaks about. My favourites are <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  I Hate the News</a> and the <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Raw Nerve series.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Rest in peace Aaron. I hope that one day I can grow up to be like you.
