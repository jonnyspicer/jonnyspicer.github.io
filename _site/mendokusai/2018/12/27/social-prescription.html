  <p>
  When perusing Hacker News today I came across <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/british-doctors-may-soon-prescribe-art-music-dance-singing-lessons-180970750/"
  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this article,</a> describing how British GPs
  are going to begin making 'social prescriptions', such as visiting museums or
  taking dance or singing lessons.
</p>
<p>
  These kinds of activities can allegedly not only help stave off various
  cognodegenerative diseases, but also help with mental health problems such as mine.
  So... should I do these?
</p>
<p>
  I did love playing trumpet in a youth jazz band back in the day. I haven't played
  in years, and I'm not sure if I could exactly practice in my new flat next month -
  I can't imagine my neighbours would take too kindly to it. But, I could do that.
</p>
<p>
  I've always wanted to learn to dance, but given how anxious I feel when
  thinking about taking lessons, I struggle to see how it could lessen my anxiety.
</p>
<p>
  I am exceptionally bad at drawing and painting, but perhaps I could learn. One
  of my friends is a model for a life drawing class, I think it could be pretty
  funny to surprise her by showing up one day.
</p>
<p>
  The museums in Guernsey don't exactly thrill me. I feel like once you've been
  once, you've been a million times.
</p>
<p>
  Is this my problem - that I write off everything straightaway without trying it?
