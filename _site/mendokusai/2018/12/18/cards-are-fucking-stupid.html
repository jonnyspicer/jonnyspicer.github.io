<meta name="description" content="It&#39;s Christmas time. Today I had to buy Christmas cards, and it reminded me that cards are fucking stupid. If you don&#39;t believe me, allow me to explain to you why this is the case. Sending cards is a completely meaningless, vapid obligation we are collectively faced with. To not send a card to every great aunt, second cousin and half-step-husband-in-law-twice-removed would be to commit a serious social faux pas. Intra-familial schisms have formed over less. If you don&#39;t send cards on birthdays, Christmases, Hanukkahs, christenings, weddings, funerals (seriously this is fucking weird), and even when somebody gets a new job, then you&#39;re an asshole, and that&#39;s just how it is. Nobody likes buying or writing or sending cards. I was overwhelmed with choice when having to buy my family each individual Christmas card today - which particular twee variation of a reindeer or Santa or a selection of presents under a tree, accompanied but a suitably obnoxious, ungenuine slogan of my love and appreciation, should I plump for this year? I am also convinced nobody actually gives a shit about receiving cards. I know I certainly don&#39;t. I open them, keep them on my desk what seems to be an appropriate length of time, and then I throw them away. They are borderline meaningless - the equivalent of liking the status of that guy you went to highschool with for two years back in eighth grade&#39;s status update that he&#39;s engaged. I don&#39;t really like it. I&#39;m pissed that he&#39;s found love and happiness and I haven&#39;t. It&#39;s a passive aggressive liking but he doesn&#39;t even realise it. Fucking Kyle. My point is, if you really give a shit about me enough to send me a Christmas card, then don&#39;t, because I won&#39;t care (actually I will care, I&#39;ll be annoyed at you for making me having to do more recycling). Send me a message. Pick up the phone. Even if you insist on writing me a card - scrawl a meaningful message inside, something I might actually take the time to respond to. Because just sending me a card on my birthday and Christmas does not show you care about me at all - it&#39;s complete bullshit, and I&#39;m sick of it." />

  <h1>Cards are fucking stupid</h1>

  <p>
  It's Christmas time. Today I had to buy Christmas cards, and it reminded me
  that cards are fucking stupid. If you don't believe me, allow me to explain to
  you why this is the case.
</p>
<p>
  Sending cards is a completely meaningless, vapid obligation we are
  collectively faced with. To not send a card to every great aunt, second cousin
  and half-step-husband-in-law-twice-removed would be to commit a serious social
  faux pas. Intra-familial schisms have formed over less. If you don't send cards
  on birthdays, Christmases, Hanukkahs, christenings, weddings, funerals (seriously
  this is fucking weird), and even when somebody gets a new job, then you're an
  asshole, and that's just how it is.
</p>
<p>
  Nobody likes buying or writing or sending cards. I was overwhelmed with choice
  when having to buy my family each individual Christmas card today - which particular
  twee variation of a reindeer or Santa or a selection of presents under a tree,
  accompanied but a suitably obnoxious, ungenuine slogan of my love and appreciation,
  should I plump for this year?
</p>
<p>
  I am also convinced nobody actually gives a shit about receiving cards. I know
  I certainly don't. I open them, keep them on my desk what seems to be an appropriate
  length of time, and then I throw them away. They are borderline meaningless - the
  equivalent of liking the status of that guy you went to highschool with for two
  years back in eighth grade's status update that he's engaged. I don't really like it.
  I'm pissed that he's found love and happiness and I haven't. It's a passive aggressive
  liking but he doesn't even realise it. Fucking Kyle.
</p>
<p>
  My point is, if you <i>really</i> give a shit about me enough to send me a Christmas
  card, then don't, because I won't care (actually I will care, I'll be annoyed at
  you for making me having to do more recycling). Send me a message. Pick up the
  phone. Even if you insist on writing me a card - scrawl a meaningful message inside,
  something I might actually take the time to respond to. Because
  just sending me a card on my birthday and Christmas does not show you care about
  me at all - it's complete bullshit, and I'm sick of it.
