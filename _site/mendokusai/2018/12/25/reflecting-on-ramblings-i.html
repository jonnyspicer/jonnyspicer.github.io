  <p>
  I think <a href="/mendokusai/2017/12/26/ramblings-i" target="_blank">Ramblings I</a>
  is probably my favourite post from Mendokusai. Written a year ago tomorrow, it
  was when I was in the eye of the storm, a surprisingly moment of tranquility
  amid a torrent of anguish.
</p>
<p>
  The sentiment I expressed is one I would do well to remember more often, if I
  were ever to do some kind of daily affirmation type-thing, then this would likely
  be a part of it. 'Why do I have to be so ground down in order to feel so much
  love for the people around me?'
