<meta name="description" content="Today I read this article, which talks about depression changing the language people use in speech and writing. Some of the points it makes are (very) intuitive, such as that depressed people tend to use more negative words, or deal in absolutes.

They rarely talk about &#39;they&#39;s, because they do not feel connected enough with people around them to relate to or talk about them.

  Today I read <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/people-with-depression-use-language-differently/"
  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this article,</a> which talks about depression
  changing the language people use in speech and writing.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the points it makes are (very) intuitive, such as that depressed people
  tend to use more negative words, or deal in absolutes. I thought it was super
  interesting that depressed people use first person singular pronouns more often
  than not depressed people, in part because it is less obvious, and also because
  it's something I know I do a tonne in my own writing.
</p>
<p>
  The effect is supposedly linked to the social isolation experienced by people
  with depression. They rarely talk about 'they's, because they do not feel connected
  enough with people around them to relate to or talk about them. One of my biggest
  complaints about the way I write is that I start too many sentences with 'I feel',
  'I think' etc, but I have allowed it, as the purpose of writing here is of course
  to express myself.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe I will start writing about other people more, although I'm not sure
  that they'd appreciate it.
