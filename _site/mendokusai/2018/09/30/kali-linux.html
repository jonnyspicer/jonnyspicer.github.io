Please don’t look inside my machine, it’s embarrassing. But at least it works.After some struggles (including having to walk to town to buy a flash drive large enough to write an OS to), I managed to get Kali up and running. There was a fairly prolonged moment of terror when it announced that it was rewriting the entire disk I had given it, and I was significantly less than 100% sure I had selected the correct one, however fortunately on this occasion I hadn’t fucked it up. Linux is a whole new world for me though and it’ll take me a while to get up and running… for example I have installed Brave but am unable to run it, as apparently you can’t run it as the root user for some reason… Either way, I am excited to learn about what Kali can do." />
