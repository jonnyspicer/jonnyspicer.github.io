But now, thanks to the magic of algorithms, dopamine addiction and capitalism, information is now longer evaluated on its proximity to the truth or validity of any supporting body of evidence, instead our social discourse is polarised, and only the voices at either end of the spectrum are heard. This is, uh, obviously bad, and I don’t really think I need to explain why. What I am interested though, is trying to help Charlie evaluate this “information” for what it is - unlikely to be actual information.
