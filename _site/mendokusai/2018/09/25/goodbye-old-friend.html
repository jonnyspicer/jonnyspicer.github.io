<meta name="description" content="As of this week, I have finally parted ways with a trusted companion of 10 years, whom I had shared much of my life with, entrusted with my darkest secrets, and shared many moments of joy, sorrow and wonder. I am of course referring to Google Chrome, in particular the recent release of it’s version 69, which does not live up to it’s name at all - all it does is take, it does not give at all. With there no longer being a distinction between signing into Google services and signing into Chrome, as well as some very dubious cloud sync settings and “clear cookies” not actually clearing cookies, it is clear Google no longer gives a shit about an open internet and just wants to exploit you for $$$. I guess I can’t blame them, I’m sure a disgusting amount of cash is a pretty good way to smooth over any ethical wrinkles you might have towards your own work if you’re a Chrome developer.I don’t see the point of whining too much about the Google changes, as there are plenty of other, far more articulate, blog posts out there which get the point across far better than I could. But, I am excited by the move to Firefox. Trying to move my life away from the services of the Big Five and to open source/decentralised platforms is one of my goals for the rest of 2018. Hopefully Firefox is the first step towards that, although I will probably try out Brave and re-install Tor as well, plus will still be testing any code I run on Chrome of course." />
