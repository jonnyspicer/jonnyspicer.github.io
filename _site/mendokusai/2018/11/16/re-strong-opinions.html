  Dear Ted,
</p>
<p>
  When I think about your blog, there are only two posts that spring to mind. The first
  is that Spanish one about the orange or the orange tree or something that you were
  too ashamed to link me to. The other is one that I think was entitled 'Strong
  Opinions'. The basic point you made was that you had a lot of strong opinions that
  were weakly held. You felt (and I agree) that being able to change your opinions
  in light of new evidence on the subject is admirable and demonstrative of an
  open and inquisitive mind. But conversely, having no especially strongly held opinions
  is, well, kind of pathetic. If you consider yourself intellectually superior
  enough to be able to change your mind on something, why can you not make your
  mind up about something in the first place?
</p>
<p>
  For my whole life, I have shied away from voicing my opinion on any topic I felt
  was divisive, controversial, or where there was a possibility that expressing my
  thoughts could lower somebody else's esteem for me. Well, no more. We do not live
  in a time where it is morally justifiable to simply try to sit on the fence, appease
  everyone, and be 'open to changing my mind'. Society needs to change, and I have a
  responsibility to do my bit to try to change it. I am going to seek out strong opinions
  to strongly hold. I am going to find out precisely which hills I plan to die on.
