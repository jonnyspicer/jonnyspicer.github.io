Paraphrased: Poker is so frustrating. In almost everything else in life, you get instant feedback... like in cooking. If you burn your food, you know you fucked up.

  I caught up with a poker friend that I had not spoken to in a very
  long time over the weekend. He had just got back into playing full time
  after having taken a year away from the game to complete his studies,
  and his reflections on his return to the game were insightful and
  hilarious in equal measure.
