Paraphrased: Poker is so frustrating. In almost everything else in life, you get instant feedback... like in cooking. If you burn your food, you know you fucked up. In poker, you can play perfectly and still burn your food over and over again. Hearing him say that sentence made me unbelievably glad I no longer have to deal with the stress of playing poker full time." />

  I caught up with a poker friend that I had not spoken to in a very
  long time over the weekend. He had just got back into playing full time
  after having taken a year away from the game to complete his studies,
  and his reflections on his return to the game were insightful and
  hilarious in equal measure.
