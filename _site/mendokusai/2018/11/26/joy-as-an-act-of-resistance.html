<meta name="description" content="Twice this year, I have listened to an album for the first time, and the message it contained was exactly what I needed to hear in the moment. The first was Graduating Life&#39;s nearly-eponymous &#39;Grad Life&#39;, a semi-underground emo-punk album filled with wall to wall bangers. The second was IDLES&#39; &#39;Joy as an Act of Resistance&#39;, the British punk powerhouse&#39;s followup to 2017 breakout success &#39;Brutalism&#39;. After seeing it crop up a couple of times in some early &#39;album of the year&#39; lists I finally decided to give it a listen, despite having been fairly dismissive of the recent British punk resurgence in favour of their moodier, more introspective American counterparts. Even though the band rejecting the &#39;punk&#39; label, I am firmly slapping it on them - the album is a proper punk album, with the righteous anger of the movement&#39;s founders in the 70s, but updated for the 2018 British public dealing with Brexit, racism and a society rife with division. The song &#39;Never Fight a Man with a Perm&#39; features one of my favourite lyrics possibly ever: Me, oh me, oh my, Roy You look like a walking thyroid You&#39;re not a man, you&#39;re a gland You&#39;re one big neck with sausage hands I can&#39;t really describe how good it is. It made me feel a way I haven&#39;t felt in a long time. Angry - but determined to do something about. Not content to do nothing. Spurred to act, to facilitate the changes that I want to see, rather than merely whine about them on a blog that nobody reads. Go listen to it." />

  <h1>Joy as an act of resistance</h1>

  <p>
    26 Nov 2018
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  Twice this year, I have listened to an album for the first time, and the
  message it contained was exactly what I needed to hear in the moment.
  The first was Graduating Life's nearly-eponymous 'Grad Life', a semi-underground
  emo-punk album filled with wall to wall bangers. The second was IDLES'
  'Joy as an Act of Resistance', the British punk powerhouse's followup
  to 2017 breakout success 'Brutalism'.
</p>
<p>
  After seeing it crop up a couple of times in some early 'album of the year'
  lists I finally decided to give it a listen, despite having been fairly
  dismissive of the recent British punk resurgence in favour of their moodier,
  more introspective American counterparts. Even though the band rejecting the 'punk'
  label, I am firmly slapping it on them - the album is a proper punk album,
  with the righteous anger of the movement's founders in the 70s, but updated
  for the 2018 British public dealing with Brexit, racism and a society rife
  with division.
</p>
<p>
  The song 'Never Fight a Man with a Perm' features one of my favourite lyrics possibly
  ever:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Me, oh me, oh my, Roy<br />
    You look like a walking thyroid<br />
    You're not a man, you're a gland<br />
    You're one big neck with sausage hands
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I can't really describe how good it is. It made me feel a way I haven't felt
  in a long time. Angry - but determined to do something about. Not content
  to do nothing. Spurred to act, to facilitate the changes that I want to see, rather
  than merely whine about them on a blog that nobody reads. Go listen to it.
