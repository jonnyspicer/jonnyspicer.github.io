  I absolutely do not have my shit together. Every day is a constant struggle to
  stave off the impending threat of an existential meltdown. I am perpetually
  fighting the feeling that I am not x, y or z enough, for practically every
  combination of those three letters. Somedays, it really gets me down.
</p>
<p>
  Today, I read <a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2014/may/21/everyone-is-totally-just-winging-it"
    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> wonderful,
  uplifting (and short, in case you were getting worried) article from 2014 in The Guardian,
  entitled 'Everyone is totally just winging it, all the time'. It is an idea
  that on some level, of course I know, and I think everybody knows, we are just
  exceptionally bad at remembering it.
</p>
<p>
  Nobody knows if they are on the 'right' career path, if their current relationship
  is the One (with a capital 'O'), or if and when they might meet the One, if they
  should go back to school, drop out of school, persevere with school, start a school.
  Nobody is completely content with their relationships, with the way they look,
  with their job, or with their life.
</p>
<p>
  BUT you fuckers try so hard to pretend like you <i>are</i> on top of all of that
  shit. And it makes everyone around you believe it, and feel like they should be
  cruising down life's highway too. But they're not, their engine's spluttering,
  there's smoke coming out of the hood and they're 90% sure that smell is burning.
  Please, <i>please</i> can we collectively agree to drop this facade. Yes, I know
  it will be difficult, that it is deeply ingrained, and you are scared. But we've got
  to stop this, before we're all fucking miserable, despite posting smiling selfies
  with 'live laugh love' captions.
</p>
<p>
  Your move.
