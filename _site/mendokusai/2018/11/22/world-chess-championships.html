<meta name="description" content="After the first 10 games of the Open World Chess Championships, it&#39;s 5 points all, with every game having been a draw. There has been a lot of criticism in public media for these games all being ended peacefully - which is a little odd, seeing as the world seems more interested in this match than usual. It&#39;s a little depressing that people still don&#39;t see beauty in the draws - they just want blood over the board. And, to be fair there has been blood - there have been thrills and spills, mistakes, opening novelties, and sacrifices. It just so happens that all of these have balanced out thusfar. I wish people would stop complaining and enjoy the game. There hasn&#39;t even been a single Berlin Defence yet - how can you say that&#39;s boring?! On a related note, today was game 4 of the final of the Women&#39;s World Chess Championship. I was super happy that one of my favourite players, reigning champ Ju Wenjun managed to secure a win with black in a scenario where she had to secure the full point not to concede the title altogether. I&#39;m hopeful she can overcome her opponent, Kateryna Lagno in the rapid tiebreaks. However... the waya lot of people talk about womens&#39; chess is disgusting. Everyone is eager to jump on any minor inaccuracy, only discoverable to humans with the aid of a supercomputer, and slander the combatants as bad, the games as a comedy of errors. These players are top grandmasters, regardless of what gender their opposition may be, they are undeniably experts in their field. Their ratings are invariably much, much higher than the majority of their detractors (although I was upset to see some strong male players also disparage the match). It reminds me a lot of Marilyn vos Savant and the Monty Hall Problem. I had hoped that society had progressed meaningfully in the brief 30 or so years since that happened, but it seems not, and that misogyny is still deep-rooted in our collective consciousness. People fucking suck." />

  <p>
  After the first 10 games of the Open World Chess Championships, it's 5 points all,
  with every game having been a draw. There has been a lot of criticism in public media
  for these games all being ended peacefully - which is a little odd, seeing as
  the world seems more interested in this match than usual. It's a little depressing
  that people still don't see beauty in the draws - they just want blood over the board.
  And, to be fair there has been blood - there have been thrills and spills, mistakes,
  opening novelties, and sacrifices. It just so happens that all of these have
  balanced out thusfar. I wish people would stop complaining and enjoy the game.
  There hasn't even been a single Berlin Defence yet - how can you say that's boring?!

  On a related note, today was game 4 of the final of the Women's World Chess Championship.
  I was super happy that one of my favourite players, reigning champ Ju Wenjun managed
  to secure a win with black in a scenario where she had to secure the full point
  not to concede the title altogether. I'm hopeful she can overcome her opponent,
  Kateryna Lagno in the rapid tiebreaks.

  However... the waya lot of people talk about womens' chess is disgusting. Everyone is eager
  to jump on any minor inaccuracy, only discoverable to humans with the aid of a
  supercomputer, and slander the combatants as bad, the games as a comedy of errors.
  These players are top grandmasters, regardless of what gender their opposition may be,
  they are undeniably experts in their field. Their ratings are invariably much, much
  higher than the majority of their detractors (although I was upset to see some strong
  male players also disparage the match).
