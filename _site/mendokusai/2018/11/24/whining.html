  Somedays, you just need to have a good whine, and today is one of those days.
</p>
<p>
  My wrists hurt, my gym session today felt lethargic and weak and I think I
  hurt my shoulder, driving to and from the gym was as frustrating and terrifying
  as ever, I feel like I've eaten too much the past two days, I have done virtually
  nothing productive today, I haven't made any real effort to talk to anyone today
  even though I wanted to do, I have felt super anxious all day, and I'm exhausted.
