<meta name="description" content="When I first started this blog, it was solely to win a bet. The idea behind our blog-a-day last longer was in part that we could go back and read our old blogs, and see how our ideas had changed and how we&#39;d grown as people. I totally won the bet. But recently, I have come to see the value in reflecting on some of my old posts, which was the motivation for the bet itself. So I wanted to write some posts where I revisit old writing, ideas, outlooks on life. These are obviously all relatively recent (unless I can dig out some old bits and pieces off since-deleted social media or similar), but I am surprised at some of the things I wrote mere months ago. Where better to start then with the first post on this blog, Gambling and Catharsis, posted on 16th October 2017, a little over a year ago now. There isn&#39;t much that I say in that post that I haven&#39;t already said in this one, but the one thing that stands out to me is that I still obviously consider myself a poker player/gambler at the time. There is still hope there that I will make it work and be successful in that arena, which I have since abandoned. I&#39;m not sure if it was naïveté, if I was putting on a front, if I knew I was doomed already or what. It&#39;s tough to say whether or not I miss that feeling, or want it back, or wish I was still playing poker, if I could swap my current &quot;career&quot; for another shot at it, if I wish I had had more success with the game. Either way - I learned a lot, about myself, about the world, and about life." />

  When I first started this blog, it was solely to win a bet. The idea
  behind our blog-a-day last longer was in part that we could go back
  and read our old blogs, and see how our ideas had changed and how
  we'd grown as people.
</p>
<p>
  I totally won the bet.
</p>
<p>
  But recently, I have come to see the value in reflecting on some of
  my old posts, which was the motivation for the bet itself. So I wanted
  to write some posts where I revisit old writing, ideas, outlooks on life.
  These are obviously all relatively recent (unless I can dig out some old
  bits and pieces off since-deleted social media or similar), but I am surprised
  at some of the things I wrote mere months ago.
