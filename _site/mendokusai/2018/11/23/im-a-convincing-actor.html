  <p>
  Today I talked a little to one of my remote coworkers about my mental health
  issues. I've deliberately tried to hide it as much as possible at work, for
  fear it could affect my employability or my status within the company, but
  I trust the guy I talked to, and I don't think he'll say anything to anyone.
</p>
<p>
  It's not especially enjoyable to have to hide it, and I am relatively open
  to talking about things these days, so it was something of a relief to tell
  him, and have one fewer person to have to hide it from. One of the things he
  said really tickled me though - he had no idea, and wouldn't have pegged me
  as someone with any kind of problem at all. It's somewhat reassuring - I have,
  for the most part, stopped putting much effort into covering up my 'secret' (which
  I talk about somewhat candid about on this blog). But it seems, I am a good actor,
  and am so immersed in my character of somebody-who's-fine, that most people
  can't tell the difference. I'm glad I still have the ability to fool people,
  if necessary.
