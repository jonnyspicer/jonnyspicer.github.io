  <p>
  For a few years now, I have been a fan of the idea that your happiness is
  your reality minus your expectations. It seems to make a lot of sense to me,
  but I have never been very happy, despite having what I thought were low
  expectations. Having thought about it a little more recently, with some help
  from my therapist... I actually have insane, wholly unrealistic expectations.
  Here are some of them:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I expect to improve my front end web dev skills very rapidly, across multiple
    languages and frameworks;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to improve my back end web dev skills very rapidly, across multiple
    languages and frameworks;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to pick up other software development skills and programming languages,
    including machine learning in python, native app development, c++ development,
    unit testing, scalable database management...;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to improve my computer science knowledge, and pass CS50 as quickly
    as possible;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to improve at basic maths, including linear algebra and algorithms;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to learn about the world, and keep up to date with the latest news
    in technology and science;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to learn about penetration, be able to secure bug bounties, and
    keep up with CVEs for all major platforms and devices;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to be working on multiple coding side-projects, be building useful
    applications and growing my portfolio;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to be completely comfortable using the Linux command line to do anything,
    as well as having an excellent knowledge of Windows and MacOS;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to be able to understand every stage of deployment and scaling for an
    app on an Apache server, and have a thorough understanding of Apache in general;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to go to the gym 5-6 times a week, and see an improvement in my
    cardiovascular fitness and all three main lifts;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to eat less and lose weight;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to get better at chess;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to maintain a group of friends, spend time with them,
    and get closer to some of them;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to be likeable, unawkward, and easily form a rapport with new people
    I meet;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to spend more time with my brother, give him good advice and help him
    be happier and maximise his life experience;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect not to upset, anger or disappoint my friends, family or coworkers;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect myself to have other hobbies and interests outside of tech, chess
    and the gym, and I expect myself to try and be open to trying new things;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to get 8+ hours of sleep every night;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect my career to progress rapidly;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect myself to overcome my anxiety and depression;
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to be able to do this, with only 24 hours in a day, without succumbing
    to stress, while being able to balance relaxation that doesn't contribute to
    my personal growth, eg following esports.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Why I expect all this is a story for another day. But, I think I figured out
  why I'm sad all the time.
