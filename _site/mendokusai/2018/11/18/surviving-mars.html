  Today was the first time in a long time that I decided I was going to play video games
  all day and not feel guilty about it. I managed to go to the gym and take a long
  call too, but I've smashed out a solid 8 hours of Surviving Mars. It's a lot
  of fun, a solid 7/10 of a game, and allowing myself to relax and do something I
  enjoy with no pressure, for a whole day, felt great. I'm glad I still have it
  in me to do this.
