  Flirting is hard, especially when your anxiety-to-social-skills ratio is as
  off-kilter as mine. It's not really something I partake in very much, as I
  don't have a clue how you're meant to do it, which means that when I do,
  I am... <a href="/mendokusai/2018/11/25/everyone-is-totally-winging-it" target="_blank">
  totally winging it, again.</a>
</p>
<p>
  It is a lot of fun though. Especially when it might actually lead somewhere.
