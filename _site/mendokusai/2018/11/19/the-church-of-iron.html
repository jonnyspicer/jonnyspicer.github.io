  The gym is infinitely more therapeutic than this 'talking about my feelings'
  bullshit. Or getting blackout drunk. Or, uhh, therapy. It's taken more 5 or so
  months to ease back into the routine and be able to start making progress, but
  I'm happy I've done it this way. I've tried to keep my injury risk as low as possible
  and I have yet to injure myself, touch wood. I've been able to pretty consistent
  about going 4-5 times a week, by only going for an hour at a time and not burning
  myself out too much. I've tried to keep things light, build my confidence, and resist
  the temptation to lift with my ego.
</p>
<p>
  And finally, I am seeing progress. My lifts are slowly going up. I see some
  small physical differences. I feel slightly better about my body, and I feel
  better in general. 10/10 heartily recommend the church of iron.
