  <h1>Obligations</h1>

  <p>
    30 Nov 2018
    
    
  </p>

  <p>
  On this week's episode of 'things my therapist says...', we have the word 'should'.
  If I start saying 'I should...' she always asks me: 'Why? Why should you?'.
  I can rarely muster an answer to convince myself, let alone her. She postulates
  that if I didn't feel such strong obligations on such flimsy bases, perhaps
  I might be happier.
</p>
<p>
  I think she has a very good point, but tonight I still feel a strong sense of
  obligation. It's Friday evening, and I have a long and tough week at work. I
  would like to relax and play video games, but I have multiple personal projects
  that I feel compelled to work on, frontend code I should write, APIs I should learn, blog
  posts I should compose.
</p>
<p>
  What if I never said 'should' again?
