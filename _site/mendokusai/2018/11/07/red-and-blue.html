  It is pretty bizarre to me how big a part of news media aimed at me consists
  of US politics. Even UK politics ought not to effect me that much, given
  that Guernsey is self-governing, but I can forgive people here an interest
  in our mainland counterparts. American politics on the other hand... is
  thousands of miles away. I hope it will never really effect me, and I suspect
  it will certainly never meaningful change my existence unless we enter some
  kind of mutually-assured-destruction scenario.
</p>
<p>
  With that being said, I have in general pretty liberal views, and more and
  more governments across the world seem to be shifting to the right. I think
  this is, uh, bad. Because it's incongruent with my views, and I'm a bit
  worried about what's going to become of humanity as a species if our
  societies shift that way. I don't really know anything about anything
  though, so I probably don't really get to have an opinion on the subject
  of politics.
</p>
<p>
  With all that being said, I read a little about the results of the US
  mid terms today, and in general it seemed positive for us liberal snowflakes.
  So, good job everybody.
