<meta name="description" content="Painting my nails has been a surprisingly enlightening experience, and has a few benefits. The actual process is very therapeutic and relaxing. It’s a good litmus test for people - if someone reacts weirdly or says something odd, they are probably not the greatest of human beings. It forces me to care less about how others may judge me and not worry about trying to conform to some bell curve of normality. It allows me to express myself in some small way, something I am habitually terrible at. I would highly recommend it." />
