  We play basketball as a warm up for most fencing sessions, and everyone, myself included, is terrible. Everything about my game is woeful apart from arguably my work rate. When I first started, my shot technique was that of a prepubescent girl, and my FGM% was probably less than 10. Several months later, and my percentages aren’t a tonne higher, but my shot technique is now closer to an awkward mid-puberty boy who has just experienced a growth spurt and doesn’t know how long his own limbs are. I am still objectively bad, but making progress feels really, really satisfying, and makes the game a lot more fun.
