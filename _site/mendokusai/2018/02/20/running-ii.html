<meta name="description" content="Guernsey is a small place, and I have lived here the majority of my life. When I first owned a car, I loved being able to leave the house and just drive. Nowhere in particular, just away from where I was.Not that I could geographically go very far, but there were still a handful of places I would visit, one after another, in search of solitude. Usually I’d start by driving north, stopping at some of the beach car parks. I would sit in my car, in the dark, and look out to the sea, expansive and cold. I’d drive to the west, and walk out to Fort Houmet. I remember once there was scaffolding up on the outside of the main building, so naturally I climbed up it and explored a little.Other times I’d drive around the cliffs at the south, or circle the island and visit every spot I’d made out with some girl when I was younger. It wasn’t a lot, but it felt like freedom.Yesterday I went running. I usually run the same route every time, stopping at a particular lamppost, turning round and going back the way I had come. But it seemed like my phone was getting confused and not tracking the return distance properly, making it look like I had run half the distance I actually had. So, this time, I ran past the lamppost, and took the next left, thinking I could circle round, get onto a road I knew, and head back, all properly tracked by a handy running app and my phone’s inbuilt GPS. But… that left-turn didn’t lead to where I had expected it to. In fact, it was somewhere I couldn’t remember ever having been before. I kept going regardless - you can never get lost on Guernsey - and was surprised by what I found. There were trees and fields populated with cows, and I was on a windy lane heading down a hill. It was misty and I couldn’t see the distance but for a moment, I was transported to a different place, somewhere other than my island home. It was like being in a different country, with nobody around. It was peaceful despite the aches and pains of running, and for the first time in a long time, I felt that fresh sense of joy I used to have while driving." />
