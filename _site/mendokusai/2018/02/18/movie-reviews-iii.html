  <b><span >Django Unchained</span></b><br /><b><span ><br /></span></b><span >A great all around film, after watching this and Pulp Fiction I think I am going to try and make my way through all of Tarantino's films in the upcoming weak.A brutal insight into the realities of slavery for those of us fortunate enough to be naive about it, this was both shocking and uplifting - another film where I couldn't help but root for the good guy. There were a couple of odd things - the score felt a little off to me, with the hip hop tracks breaking the immersion of pre-Civil War America. Also Tarantino's own cameo was odd, his attempt at a Southern drawl wasn't very convincing, and one of his on-screen friends had a seemingly blatantly Australian accent. Those things aside, I really enjoyed the film.</span><br /><b><span ><br /></span></b><b><span >Brigsby Bear</span></b><br /><b><span ><br /></span></b><span >A gem of a film. I decided to watch this purely on the recommendation of Funhaus' Elyse Willems, who named the film as her favourite under-the-radar movie of 2017, describing it as "a coming of age story, but the protagonist is 30 years old". A truly heartwarming tale with some fantastic acting performances and writing, I am unashamed to admit this film made me a little emotional. If you want something to make you feel warm and fuzzy, that's kinda weird at the same time, this is a great choice.</span><br /><b><span ><br /></span></b><b><span >Mom and Dad</span></b><br /><b><span ><br /></span></b><span >Oh boy. Oh boy oh boy oh boy. What to say about Mom and Dad.... I'll be honest. This evening, before deciding to watch this movie, I was feeling a little down. So I thought to myself, I want a movie where there is no chance I will get emotionally involved, and which I can laugh at. Not a comedy movie though, I want a trash movie that is so bad, it is comical. And this movie <i>delivered. </i>It is so dumb. The story is awful, in fact I am pretty sure the first half of the movie is the plot from infamous ecchi anime series Highschool of the Dead. I can forgive a premise being surreal or absurd, but it needs some kind of execution behind it, and the acting in this film is indescribable, in the worst way possible. I know Nic Cage has a reputation for being kinda a weird guy whose career is in decline - a meme. But his performance in this is simply awful. My highschool drama class could've done a better job than this. Insanely over the top in a way that makes no sense, although in his defense it's not like the script did anything to help. Billed as a "zany comedy horror", I laughed at all the scares and was terrified by the jokes. And don't get me started on the ending. When the end credits rolled, I couldn't help but laugh in a way I haven't in weeks. It made no sense, and was so bad that it was good, but then kept going until it was just bad again. This movie was a true disasterpiece - it was so terrible, I sort of loved it.</span>
