<meta name="description" content="I have been binge watching psychological horror movies this last week, and it is a really interesting genre to me. Horror seems to be more inundated with clichés and tropes than any film genre I have come across, so much so that a lot of the good horror films I saw recently were the ones that were self aware and managed to play off the viewers’ expectations. It’s a very hit and miss genre, there is good horror movies, well shot, good story, suspenseful but not over the time, unsettling and disturbing. Then there is bad, poor story, obviously plot, lack of empathy with the characters. And there is good-bad… when a film is so badly executed, the supposedly horrifying elements become comical instead. Some of the flicks I watched are hit and miss even with themselves, The Girl With All The Gifts being a great example. I thought parts of that movie were great, it was compelling and unexpected. But other parts were just so badly done I couldn’t help but laugh, which sadly marred the experience overall. But they have really inspired me, in a way. I wrote a while back that I wanted to start writing short stories, but in typical me fashion, I didn’t. Now however, I am determined, and my goal is to start by the end of the month. Of course I think there will be a cathartic element to it, but I enjoy the challenge of writing, so it should be fun." />
