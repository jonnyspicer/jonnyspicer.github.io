  <span >This evening I played my first few hands of poker in over 6 weeks. On my first hand I got dealt AQT6ds in bb, facing a CO open. I have no fucking clue if this is a 3b or not.</span><br /><span ><br /></span><span >It feels really good to play again, infinitely better than I thought it would. It's actually borderline fun. It took me a while to remember how to evaluate hands, but it came back very fast, and being rusty means I can just work on the absolute basics, which can't be a bad thing. Hopefully I will feel motivated to play tomorrow too.</span>
