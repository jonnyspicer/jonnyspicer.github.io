I lasted less than 30 minutes into my namesake, Amnesia I, before alt+f4ing and never playing again. I think the last horror movie I watched was The Shining, which I survived only because of how dated it is. I have never understood the appeal of the genre - fear is a negative emotion, so why would anyone willing experience it? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But it is nonetheless an emotion, and an experience, often an intense one.
