  <h1>Things That Go Bump In The Night</h1>

  I very rarely watch films but after enjoying my 4-movie binge yesterday, I'm going to try and watch a few more films this week.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>I've always been a giant pussy when it comes to horror movies and games. I lasted less than 30 minutes into my namesake, Amnesia I, before alt+f4ing and never playing again. I think the last horror movie I watched was The Shining, which I survived only because of how dated it is. I have never understood the appeal of the genre - fear is a negative emotion, so why would anyone willing experience it?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But it is nonetheless an emotion, and an experience, often an intense one. And often, simply feeling <i>something</i>&nbsp;strongly is a good reminder that we are alive and capable of feeling. After having watched a good 20 horror trailers today, I am going to try to ease myself into the genre and try and grow some testicles. Being the wannabe hipster I am, I'm going to start with some weird foreign films... on the docket tomorrow is recent Belgian film <i>Raw </i>and Guillermo Del Torro's <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>. I'll probably write reviews of them assuming I don't shit my pants and quit halfway through. I'm hoping to build up to <i>It</i>&nbsp;and some point soon, but not gonna hold out too much hope.</div>
