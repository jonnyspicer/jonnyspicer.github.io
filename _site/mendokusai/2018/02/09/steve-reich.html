  <h1>Steve Reich</h1>

  <span >Steve Reich is a contemporary minimalist composer whose music I have enjoyed for the past 6 or 7 years after studying one of his pieces at school and falling in love with it, and in doing so the whole genre of minimalism. The work in question was the third movement of Electric Counterpart, which compromises multiple tracks played by a single guitar played simultaneously, which have slightly different tempi or rhythms, a technique called phasing, and I sound I really enjoy listening to. Now I am slowly improving at guitar, I'm really excited at the prospect of being able to try out phasing and see if I can emulate his sound in some way.</span>
