# jonnyspicer.com

This is the source code for my personal site, hosted at [jonnyspicer.com](jonnyspicer.com). The site is built using  Github Pages and Jekyll, and as such it is exceptionally basic,
so I doubt it will be informative to anyone (except perhaps as an example of what not to do). With that being said, feel free to do whatever you'd like providing it is covered by the GPL version 3 license.

The sass is kind of a mess - please don't judge me.
