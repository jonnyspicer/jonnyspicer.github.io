This is the source code for my personal site, hosted at [jonnyspicer.com](jonnyspicer.com). The site is built using  Github Pages and Jekyll, and is covered by the GPL version 3 license.

As there are now a couple of forks of this site floating around the internet, in the future I plan to make my theme a bona fide Jekyll theme, and also provide more details on how to use
this site as a template for your own blog.

For all the python scripts to run correctly you'll need
the following packages imported, as well as to be using
the most up-to-date version of python:

- regex
- pandas
- nltk
- beautifulsoup4

```shell
pip3 install regex pandas nltk beautifulsoup4
```
