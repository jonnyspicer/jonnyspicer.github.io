regarded it with at least some modicum of suspicion. Faking anything is inherently
repressing some element of the truth, and in my personal experience, that hasn’t
gone so great for me. The FITYMI slogan is something I hear a lot though, primarily
in the context of social confidence, and during the past week I’ve revisited it
to see if I still think it’s a dangerous idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When selectively applied, I think there may be some merit to it. During my usual
ennui-fuelled Hacker News trawlings, I’ve read a little about changing one’s personality,
and while intuitively the notion invokes a slight sense of fear, it is something
I certainly want to (continue to) do. From my exceptionally limited understanding,
talking and writing using a more upbeat tone can actually influence you to
think more positively. And maybe there is some iota of wisdom in simply pretending
to be confident - it will be a challenge to learn how to pretend, but if I can overcome
it, then it might lead the way for meaningfully less anxiety in my life, something
that I would relish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balance between being truthful when things aren’t going so great, but still
remaining resolute and framing things in a favourable light is going to be a tough
one to strike, but follow along dear reader, for you will get to see my attempts
at such a balancing act right before your very eyes in the weeks to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonny Spicer</name></author><category term="Wellbeing" /><category term="Mental Health" /><summary type="html">We’ve all heard the phrase ‘fake it ‘til you make it’, and I hope we have all regarded it with at least some modicum of suspicion.

Terry A Davis. Davis’ story is remarkable; a genius programmer who single-handedly created a complex operating system, who was 
also plagued by crippling mental illness that left him further and further out of touch with the real world, all documented on 
the internet for anyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Davis was a delusion narcissist, unrepentant racist and all round asshole, and it easy to be disgusted by him or 
to pity him as a victim of schizophrenia and dismiss him altogether. But his talent for software cannot be overstated, and despite 
the obvious and deep flaws in TempleOS - ie that he believed it allowed him to commune with God - in many ways it is a borderline 
miraculous achievement (see what I did there?). Had he been mentally healthy, who knows what innovations he may have been able to 
bring to the tech community - it seems reasonable to assume that he could’ve had a meaningful impact on the operating system landscape 
today as we know it, all on his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video also offers some interesting reflections on the relationship between mental illness on the internet; both that it can enable 
those who are struggling, as well as leave them vulnerable to harrassment, but also that it can document their story, and give the 
world at large an insight into their lives that they might not otherwise have been afforded. In some ways, Davis deserved the following 
he had, and there was certainly some segment of it that was unironic and respectul in the interest they took in his life and work. I 
almost wish I had been aware of him before the fact, so that I could also have followed him, although I suspect I would’ve written 
him off too quickly as just another crazy person on the internet - the crystallisation of information presented in the documentary 
has made me think that perhaps I should reconsider not just Davis, but similar people in future situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite piece of potentially accidental wisdom from Davis during the video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That bird has no idea what he’s looking at, and yet, what does the bird do? Does he panic? No, he just does the best he can.&lt;/p&gt;

across 16 boards. Jersey could only field a weakend side, with many of their top players regrettably absent, which paved the way for a historic 
occasion (for me at least) - my first time being part of a winning team since 2010, our board two getting his 2nd individual win since his debut 
in 1983, and Guernsey’s biggest margin of victory since 1965.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only managed a draw against my opponent who I would consider myself a favourite against, but as things transpired a loss would’ve been a fairer 
result so I am glad I was able to salvage a vital half a point, and furthermore do a job for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After last year’s particularly upsetting loss where I felt somewhat responsible for Guernsey’s overall loss, I was immensely grateful to be able 
to redeem myself this year, and the pride I feel at the drubbing we have handed our island counterparts is one I will not soon forget. All that remains 
is to slowly crawl up the board order for the next few years until I have a shot at becoming Channel Island champion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonny Spicer</name></author><category term="Chess" /><summary type="html">Today was the 82nd installation of the Channel Islands Inter-Insular; the annual chess match between Guernsey and Jersey, in recent years played across 16 boards.

very much that I have made a mistake (or furthermore that I have made the mistake

&lt;p&gt;Swallowing one’s pride is a painful experience, especially when one’s whole

grow as a person it is clearly necessary. My other gut reaction is to be self-deprecating,
to simply say that I’m a sub-par human being and so of course I embody undesirable
traits, but that is not going to help me either - and frankly it is this pattern
of thinking in general that I am keen to carve out of my own brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think or say or do stupid things. And that’s absolutely fine, I think -
what is not fine is to continue to do them despite having been confronted with their
inherent stupidity.

&lt;p&gt;Feminism is a perennial topic in social discourse at large, and recently in my own life too. As a man, I’ve always been apprehensive to 
approach the subject or voice any especially strong opinions on the matter because, well, I am de facto more likely to be part of the problem 
than the solution. But, in the spirit of trying to be a better person etc etc, perhaps I have a responsibility to infilitrate my own gender 
and dismantle the patriarchy from right under its very nose! If I were to brand myself as a feminist, surely fellow men, previously wallowing 
in misogyny, will see my example and realise the error of their ways?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I mean, I doubt it. I’m hardly a bastion of masculinity, nor a leader of many men, and frankly I wouldn’t take any notice of what I said if 
I were anyone else (and neither should you, dear reader). I think there is a credible argument to be made that even if I can move the needle one iota 
towards achieving gender equality that it would be worth my time, and if it were a true freeroll, then I would absolutely agree. My suspicion is that 
it is possible that branding myself as a feminist could certainly have a downside - admittedly I think that downside would be to me personally rather than 
the movement itself, but hey, we all know you’ve gotta look out for #1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I alluded to earlier, feminism is not easy to define (at least not for my small, malformed and regrettably male brain), and that is part of my reluctance
to take on the feminist label. Given that I spend much of my time in the radically polarised echo chambers that consitute the internet, I’m all too wary of 
misandry wearing the mask of fighting for equality, and I think that particular strategy is utterly doomed to fail in its quest to make any kind of inroads. 
For plenty of real people, I very much hope that feminism does simply mean social equality, particularly equality of opportunity, but seeing as I never go outside 
of never spoken to any of these “real” people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also something very disingenious in my mind about men who vocally brand themselves as allies of the feminist cause, but perhaps that is simply my relentless 
cynicism getting the better of me. I am mortally afraid of confrontation, and, rather upsettingly, I am sure the path to social parity is going to be defined by 
confrontation, and it would seem that I am too much of a coward to be willing to die on that particular hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I don’t feel as if I have earned the right to call myself a feminist. While it’s a dirty word in certain dark, unpleasant smelling corners of the web, all 
the women I know who staunchly avow the cause are strong, passionate, intelligent and inspirational. They are the ones who are suffering the great many injustices of 
modern society, not myself, and who are still resilient enough to fight tooth and nail to change things. I simply don’t deserve to ride on their 
coattails until I have actually done something meaningful to bring about change, and so until that happens, my reticence to call myself a feminist shall remain.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonny Spicer</name></author><category term="Social Issues" /><summary type="html">The Oxford English Dictionary defines femini- just kidding, fuck that.</summary></entry></feed>
