  I was inspired today by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-went-from-newbie-to-software-engineer-in-9-months-while-working-full-time-460bd8485847&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;
  this&lt;/a&gt; Medium article. I know inspiration will fade quickly, but
  I am hoping I can hold onto at least one thing from this article -
  it is never to late to start contributing to open source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One of the reasons I am a web developer is because I care a lot
  about the internet - I want it to be fast, accessible, to connect
  people and to improve our lives. Contributing to open source
  technology might seem sinful to some people, particularly in
  other professions. Giving up my time and expertise, for free?
  Volunteering, but not for those in need, for other developers?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Well, in my infinite ignorance, I think it's a noble cause. To have
  the opportunity to contribute to a large, growing, evolving codebase
  would feel amazing, and I am hoping I will have that opportunity soon.
  Imagine when I get my first patch in a big project... It's going to feel
  like a huge achievement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The article linked above says it's never to early to start contributing,
  and I suspect this is true, especially given I don't actually have to
  contribute code, nor do I have to contribute to a major library.
  There are some pretty massive projects out there with terrible documentation -
  Drupal, I am looking at you - so something like that seems like a natural
  place to start. Obviously I am not going to try to write documentation
  for Drupal though, because that would require understanding it, and honestly
  Drupal is nuts to me. My weekend homework (once this site is finished)
  is going to be researching the best way to start my open source journey -
  hopefully it is a long one.

  This is the first daily post which is going to be uploaded to this new
  Jekyll site on the same day it was published! The URL is currently
  jonnyspicer.github.io but assuming I get everything finished by the
  end of the weekend, I'll swap the domain over to jonnyspicer.com -
  an exciting time. It has taken a long time for me to even start this project
  and in the end, it didn't even require that many hours, &amp;lt;20 so far,
  including having to learn Jekyll.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Overall I am pretty happy, I like the minimal look, Jekyll has not been
  painless but it hasn't been excruciating either. There is a bit more
  effort involed in actually generating a blog post then there would be
  with a CMS, as evidenced by the fact I am writing this in my text editor
  - there's no wysiwyg to catch any embarrassing spelling mistakes. I also
  have to manually generate the post file with a specific date/name convention
  but after the site is complete I'll write a script to do that for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Left to do as of 10th Oct 2018:
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Set up home page with excerpts of last post in each blog;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Change blog pages to just show last 5-10 posts for each blog,
      with dates;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Add full archive pages, grouped by date;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Review mobile/tablet styling (should just be changing font size...);
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Add CNAME file to repo;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Change DNS for jonnyspicer.com to point to this site.
    &lt;/li&gt;

  Programming is such a bizarre series of ups and downs. One moment I
  have crippling imposter syndrome - I feel like I don't deserve the job
  I have at all, and feel like I should quit to save my boss the trouble
  of realising how awful I am and firing me. But the next, I have written
  a function which has a little complexity, is decently efficient, and I
  worked hard on - I'm proud of it, and proud of myself by proxy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Like everything else in life, this process is pretty exhausting. I am
  na√Øvely hoping that it will get better as I get better at programming -
  but I know it won't. Oh well.

I still think there is an objective argument that society is trash, and that is a good reason to feel depressed, but it seems my main strategy for dealing with that right now is just to, uh, try not to think about it. Just like I'm not thinking about a big pink elephant right now. Fuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm trying to think of things to be optimistic about.

I am scared about what they have already done to our society and what they continue to do, that they are eroding not only the foundations of the internet but also our basic human right to privacy, and tearing at our social fabric.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Sure, my tinfoil hat is pretty screwed on at this point, but I'm not sure I need to explain in too much detail why I think these companies are bad, it just seems as a society we have collectively accepted our fate. But, in an effort to make myself feel better about life, a couple of weeks ago, I decided to see how much of these five companies I could remove from my life. The answer is - not very much. But here is what I found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span &gt;Microsoft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span &gt;Microsoft is probably the company out of the five that I have the least qualms with, however this could be due to lack of sensationalist articles on Hacker News about them more than any kind of higher level of business ethics. The fact they don't run their own ad network helps a lot, as does the fact they sell proprietary products, and ironically the fact I don't use any Bing services probably means I like them more as I am have no idea what their ad or tracking policies are like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;At the moment my home PC and all my laptops (and a VM) are running various versions of Windows. As of this weekend, my PC now dual-boots Windows 10 and Kali Linux, but I can't see myself ever making the switch full time to Linux, due to the lack of software support on the latter. I'm excited to get to grips with Unix and try to learn some pentesting on Kali though, I think it will improve my computing knowledge a lot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span &gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span &gt;Ah, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DN1TIDZPH4&quot;&gt;Zark Fuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, get your hands out of my data. I would put money on Facebook being the first test case for GDPR in EU court, after another massive breach this past week. The old &quot;if you're not paying, you're the product&quot; isn't quite as poetic and universally true as some might think, but in Facebook's case I absolutely believe it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Sadly... I am struggling to carve Facebook out of my life. Despite having deactivated my Facebook account proper, I have retained use of its Messenger app, as it's the way I communicate with most of my friends, and I fear ditching that too would leave me something of a social leper. You win this time, Fuckerberg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span &gt;Alphabet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span &gt;Oh Google... how far you have fallen in my estimation. Once a company I trusted, now I am in the process of migrating away from as many of its services as possible, during which I have discovered quite how many Google services I previously used. Chrome 69 was really the last straw from me, despite being a Chrome user since sometime around version 1, they have shown their true colours in that all they want is your juicy, juicy data. Well, no more! Below are the services I use and what I have been replacing them with.

I haven't needed to use either service recently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span &gt;Youtube: Sadly there is no real alternative to Youtube. Its biggest competitor for video content is Facebook, withVimeo and Dailymotion quite some ways behind, both lacking content.

I am scared about what they have already done to our society and what they continue to do, that they are eroding not only the foundations of the internet but also our basic human right to privacy, and tearing at our social fabric.Sure, my tinfoil hat is pretty screwed on at this point, but I'm not sure I need to explain in too much detail why I think these companies are bad, it just seems as a society we have collectively accepted our fate. But, in an effort to make myself feel better about life, a couple of weeks ago, I decided to see how much of these five companies I could remove from my life. The answer is - not very much. But here is what I found.MicrosoftMicrosoft is probably the company out of the five that I have the least qualms with, however this could be due to lack of sensationalist articles on Hacker News about them more than any kind of higher level of business ethics. The fact they don't run their own ad network helps a lot, as does the fact they sell proprietary products, and ironically the fact I don't use any Bing services probably means I like them more as I am have no idea what their ad or tracking policies are like.&amp;nbsp;At the moment my home PC and all my laptops (and a VM) are running various versions of Windows. As of this weekend, my PC now dual-boots Windows 10 and Kali Linux, but I can't see myself ever making the switch full time to Linux, due to the lack of software support on the latter. I'm excited to get to grips with Unix and try to learn some pentesting on Kali though, I think it will improve my computing knowledge a lot.FacebookAh, Zark Fuckerberg, get your hands out of my data. I would put money on Facebook being the first test case for GDPR in EU court, after another massive breach this past week. The old &quot;if you're not paying, you're the product&quot; isn't quite as poetic and universally true as some might think, but in Facebook's case I absolutely believe it.Sadly... I am struggling to carve Facebook out of my life. Despite having deactivated my Facebook account proper, I have retained use of its Messenger app, as it's the way I communicate with most of my friends, and I fear ditching that too would leave me something of a social leper. You win this time, Fuckerberg.AlphabetOh Google... how far you have fallen in my estimation. Once a company I trusted, now I am in the process of migrating away from as many of its services as possible, during which I have discovered quite how many Google services I previously used. Chrome 69 was really the last straw from me, despite being a Chrome user since sometime around version 1, they have shown their true colours in that all they want is your juicy, juicy data. Well, no more! Below are the services I use and what I have been replacing them with. Big shout-out to https://nomoregoogle.comBrowser: Google Chrome to Brave at home, Firefox at work. Considering trying Vivaldi out too.Search engine: Google to Duck Duck Go.Email: Haven't actually ditched Gmail yet, looking into FastMail and ProtonMail as alternatives.Docs/Sheets: Docs will probably get replaced by Evernote, Sheets undecided. I haven't needed to use either service recently.Youtube: Sadly there is no real alternative to Youtube. Its biggest competitor for video content is Facebook, withVimeo and Dailymotion quite some ways behind, both lacking content. Peertube is interesting conceptually but my experience with the federated model a la Mastodon hasn't been great so far.Maps: Gmaps to OpenStreetMap which is my new favourite thing.Authenticator: In the process of migrating to AuthyBlogging: I swear to god at some point I will finally get a Jekyll site running on Github pages which will host this blog. If not I owe somebody a beer.DNS: Swapped to Cloudflare last week, works like a dream.File storage: Drive to Dropbox, will look at MEGA too.Domain: currently looking for a domain registrar that is both not in the Fortune 500 and also provides service that isn't 100% awful.... suggestions appreciated.AppleDo you have any idea how tedious it is to switch away from an iPhone once you already have an iPhone?
