&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… some unsolicited advice! The best kind. My favourite kind in fact. I am clearly in no position to lecture people 
on what they should and should not put on their Tinder profiles, but I cannot help myself from commenting on a snippet 
of one young lady’s biography that I came across the other day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t like the Big Band Theory don’t even bother swiping right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sentence physically hurt me to read. I pinched myself, worried that I was thrashing around in my bed, caught in the 
throes of a nightmare, but alas I was not - the dystopia surrounding me was very real. I wanted to scream but all that came out of 
my mouth was a canned laugh track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, now I’ve made my point, let’s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, and I am aware that this not exactly a hot take, but the Big Bang is far from the peak of comedy. My (teenage) brother 
has been a fan for years and as such I have had to sit through pretty much the entirety of the show, and the only joke that 
has elicited genuine amusement from me is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBSQswHTsw&quot;&gt;“I don’t care for perchloroethylene, and I don’t like glycol ether”&lt;/a&gt;, and frankly if you 
have the above slogan splashed across your dating profile then I suspect you do not understand it. It’s comedy for the masses, 
designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator, the equivalent of writing that you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPYiTpy5F5I&quot;&gt;love dogs, wine and travelling&lt;/a&gt;.
Except, rather than just casting the widest net possible, you are cutting off anyone not in the bell of the curve; what kind of 
generic experiences are you hoping for? How narrow is your vision, how near are your horizons? The incredible thing about people is that 
they’re all weird and wonderful and &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt;, not that they all love garbage TV. Why are you so fervent about culling Big Bang naysayers 
from your romantic prospects anyway? I can understand not wishing to entertain the thought of dating someone with different religious or political 
views, but if Mr Perfect’s favourite series is Brooklyn Nine Nine, are you really going to throw him in the trash?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all talking about the principle, and wholly ignoring that the show is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-hOigoxHs&quot;&gt;unrepentently misogynistic throughout&lt;/a&gt;, to 
the extent I don’t believe it should have a place in modern television, let alone the praise, viewership and money that it has brought in. 
The writing is cheap, has no integrity, and perpetuates a multitude of harmful stereotypes about pretty much everyone it portrays in the 
show, especially women. I may be &lt;a href=&quot;/mendokusai/2019/05/06/should-i-call-myself-a-feminist&quot;&gt;reluctant to call myself a feminist&lt;/a&gt; but if you 
are going to fight for gender equality by only aligning yourself with people who think portrayals of long-term sexual harrassment are the 
zenith of our culture, then I’m Emily Davison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. The bad news is that it’s pretty easy to blitz through the entirety of Guernsey’s Tinder population, and I have done so with little success.
I think the plan is to come back in 6 months time, try to lose some weight, get better pictures, yadda yadda yadda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news, is that little success != zero success. But maybe more on that another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy swiping, friends.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonny Spicer</name></author><category term="Dating and Relationships" /><summary type="html">There’s been both good and bad developments since my last update on the whole Tinder malarkey, but first…</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Smalltalk Revisited</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2019/05/21/smalltalk-revisited" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Smalltalk Revisited" /><published>2019-05-21T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2019/05/21/smalltalk-revisited</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2019/05/21/smalltalk-revisited">&lt;p&gt;Today I had, by far, the most in depth conversation I’ve ever had with someone while they were cutting my hair - and yes, that includes my mother.
The classic barbershop smalltalk has forever been something that terrifies me, to the extent that I have pretty bad anxiety about the whole process, 
from phoning to book an appointment, turning up and having to awkwardly wait while whoever is before me is laughing and joking around, to very Britishly 
saying ‘looks great, thanks’ when shown the back of my head, wholly irregardless of whether or not the back of my head does in fact look great. But today, 
I was determined to have some kind of conversation, even if it was only minor, and guess what - I actually did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked for a solid ten minutes, mostly about her daughter’s dance competitions in the UK, and I think I finally see the appeal of smalltalk as a whole. 
Conversation doesn’t have to be deep or meaningful, it can be slathered with thick layers of deflection, but people’s personalities will always shine 
through, and there will be shiny golden nuggets of inner beauty to be found if only I am willing to pan through the silt of having to describe what I do 
for my job and listening to a banal weekend’s plan or three.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonny Spicer</name></author><category term="Personal" /><summary type="html">Today I had, by far, the most in depth conversation I’ve ever had with someone while they were cutting my hair - and yes, that includes my mother.

and after watching it, I entirely understand that choice. The ultramarathon covers a distance of ‘100.00M’ - however ask any runner and they will say 
it is likely close to 130M, and with 120000 feet of elevation change, it is the equivalent of climbing up Everest from sea level and back down again - twice - in just 60 hours. 
The terrain is brutal, with every single competitiors legs getting slashed to pieces by briars all over the course. In order to prove that you’ve completed 
an entire loop (there are five in total - completing three is known as a ‘Fun Run’), you have to tear out pages of books that correlate to your race number, placed 
at various locations around the course. The race officially begins when the organizer lights his cigarette, which he does an hour after blowing a conch shell, 
which can be done anytime between midnight and noon on race day. When you drop out, a bugler plays Taps to signal your ‘death’. Every year, of the forty allocated 
slots, one is given to the ‘Human Sacrifice’ - a runner who has applied to be in the race, but who the organizers feel have no chance whatsoever of completing it. 
Fortunately there is a very small application fee of just $1.60 - however that must be supplemented with an essay on why you ought to be selected to run the Barkley. 
If you are selected, then you receive a letter of condolences informing you so. If this is your first time, the entry fee is a license plate from your home state or 
country, and if it’s not, then the entry fee is often a miscellaneous piece of clothing - it’s previously been socks and white shirts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s beyond ludicrous. The fact that anyone has ever completed this thing is a testament to humanity, but the fact that someone dreamed it up in the first place 
is an even bigger one. It certainly make me feel like I should aim higher.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonny Spicer</name></author><category term="Running" /><summary type="html">The Netflix documentary about The Barkley Marathons is subtitled ‘The Race That Eats Its Children’, and after watching it, I entirely understand that choice.

&lt;p&gt;As always the games have been thrilling, with some innovative strategies, cunning psychological tricks and phenomenal mechanical ability on display from players 
throughout the day. Seeing some young players do exceptionally well (three of the last 16 players in the event are 17) battling veterans that have been in the 
scene for over 10 years shows that Starcraft is still alive and kicking, and it really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; seem like the gap might be closing. With GSL’s redemption and 
renaissance storylines in full swing, and the Koreans showing remarkable depth of talent in their league, I think this year’s international tournaments are

  &lt;p&gt;If you see a faded sign at the end of the road that says
“15 miles to the 
Love Shack”
Love Shack, yeah, yeah”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to pay homage to what is comfortably the best fast food place in Guernsey. It is of course, (the) Love Shack, situated 
near the bottom of St Julian’s Avenue, and it is a 2am institution. While it’s primary fare may be kebabs, it does not deserve the low 
reputation associated with many establishments of its ilk, as the food is consistently delicious, and while not exactly being healthy, 
it is far from the greasy, oily late-night feast that one might usually expect to find after getting kicked out of the club. I think 
that the best possible endorsement I can give is that Sam and I periodically visit the Shack for dinner when we are &lt;em&gt;stone cold sober&lt;/em&gt;, 
on a weeknight no less. The Shack is always open, seemingly neverendlingly staffed by its proprietor, whose name regretfully I do not know, 
but who I have infinite respect for, for his hardwork, level of customer service and dedication to his craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God bless Love Shack.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonny Spicer</name></author><category term="Fine Dining" /><summary type="html">If you see a faded sign at the end of the road that says “15 miles to the Love Shack” Love Shack, yeah, yeah”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Four Burners</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2019/05/16/the-four-burners" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Four Burners" /><published>2019-05-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2019/05/16/the-four-burners</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2019/05/16/the-four-burners">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/four-burners-theory&quot;&gt;The four burners theory&lt;/a&gt; is a neat summarisation of something I have been feeling a lot recently. When I ramp up the intensity at work, 
my health slips. When I try to spend more time with my friends, I don’t see my family as much as I would like to. It seems I can’t have it all at once, and reading somebody else’s 
thoughts on it has given me some fresh ones of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious one is: do I actually want to “really successful”? What does that even mean, and what metrics are we using? I will always choose happiness as my metric of choice 
for success, and I think there is a compelling argument that living a rounded life (the four burners on dim strategy) might be the way to maximise my happiness. Intuitively, this 
feels like the wrong solution though - as a function of my high expectations, I think I will likely have to turn a burner or two off, that I might excel in something else to secure 
the gratification I so desire. My career ambitions remain lofty, and I believe they’re eminently reachable, but might take some sacrifices to get there. My health is never going to be 
the burner that is switched off, but it is also unlikely to ever be put above all else either. Connecting with other people is what I think ultimately makes me happiest, so it seems 
the family and friends burners are important also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Mr Clear’s three options are all excellent, and worth considering. Embracing constraints is undoubtedly something I am going to try and do more - my time is limited, so I should 
try to ensure that as much of it as possible is spent on one of the aforementioned four buckets. Outsourcing would be significantly easier if I had more disposable income, but it could 
be something worth considering when contemplating future career decisions and salary considerations. As for seasons… I am as yet unswayed. I want it all, I want it now, and I expect 
I will always want it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one day I’ll figure it out. Expect a followup in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonny Spicer</name></author><category term="Wellbeing" /><summary type="html">The four burners theory is a neat summarisation of something I have been feeling a lot recently.

regarded it with at least some modicum of suspicion. Faking anything is inherently
repressing some element of the truth, and in my personal experience, that hasn’t
gone so great for me. The FITYMI slogan is something I hear a lot though, primarily
in the context of social confidence, and during the past week I’ve revisited it
to see if I still think it’s a dangerous idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When selectively applied, I think there may be some merit to it. During my usual
ennui-fuelled Hacker News trawlings, I’ve read a little about changing one’s personality,
and while intuitively the notion invokes a slight sense of fear, it is something
I certainly want to (continue to) do. From my exceptionally limited understanding,
talking and writing using a more upbeat tone can actually influence you to
think more positively. And maybe there is some iota of wisdom in simply pretending
to be confident - it will be a challenge to learn how to pretend, but if I can overcome
it, then it might lead the way for meaningfully less anxiety in my life, something
that I would relish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balance between being truthful when things aren’t going so great, but still
remaining resolute and framing things in a favourable light is going to be a tough
one to strike, but follow along dear reader, for you will get to see my attempts
at such a balancing act right before your very eyes in the weeks to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonny Spicer</name></author><category term="Wellbeing" /><category term="Mental Health" /><summary type="html">We’ve all heard the phrase ‘fake it ‘til you make it’, and I hope we have all regarded it with at least some modicum of suspicion.
