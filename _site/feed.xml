  Today I started a new Trello list, one that I'm excited about. It's
  titled &quot;Things that give me hope&quot;. It sounds a little intense, implying
  that I have very little hope outside of these few things, but given
  the current social climate, can you really blame me? I'm sure I will share
  more of the list in the future, but here is what I have so far;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecorrespondent.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Correspondent&lt;/a&gt;
    - a new way of thinking about news journalism, with less corporate greed and
    more honesty and transparency. The English version is not yet live,
    but I am excited about it nonetheless, and I hope it lives up to its
    not unsubstantial promises.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;80000 Hours&lt;/a&gt; -
    research and evidence based career advice for people who want to
    have more job satisfaction and change the world for the better in
    the process.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt; -
    I have linked to the Open Source Initiative page, but OS is far more
    than that, it is a movement, and something that gives me a lot of hope
    in general. The fact that cyber-charity is such a big deal, and
    &quot;donating&quot; time and effort to it has very tangible career benefits,
    is one of the great advantages the computing industry has over others.

  For over a year I've had a Trello list of blog ideas. Most of them are
  ones I want to write about at length, as they are complex topics with a
  lot of meaning to me, and because of that I rarely find the time or the
  motivation to write about them. One of the ideas that has sat on the list
  since the beginning, is a series of posts about some of the people who have
  changed my life. There's a handful of people out there who made a massive
  impact on the person I am today, and I am happier and more confident because
  of them. Two of the people in my mental list don't even know this, as
  we are not really close, or even really friends. Our interactions were years
  ago, but they taught me something valuable.

  Today I am happy to announce I made my first open source contribution!
  Admittedly all I did was correct a handful of typos in the project docs,
  but nonetheless it felt good when my pull request got accepted. Even if
  this was not a contribution of any serious significance or skill, I am
  hoping that it marks the first of many, and will serve as a stepping stone
  towards making meaningful additions to bigger projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

  Thank you so much to David Pinheiro for being so kind with me and my
  first pull request. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://davrodpin.github.io/mole/&quot;&gt;

  Chess players are infuriating. Trying to organise them is like trying to
  herd cats. Trying to converse with them is like trying to draw blood from a

  Sleep is undoubtedly one of the most +EV things in life, and one which
  we all seem to wilfully disregard far too often. Tonight, I stayed up
  &quot;past my bedtime&quot; as it were, but did I achieve something meaningful
  because of it? I hope so...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  On one hand, I finally managed to boot Ubuntu on my old laptop, after
  thinking I'd bricked the entire thing multiple times during the process.
  It's slow, but it's light and portable, and will make a nice machine
  to code on-the-go without shelling out a grand for a Macbook.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  On another hand, I had a bizarre conversation with a girl... I have
  no idea if I really learned anything or if this was +EV. Relating
  to people and not PCs is definitely something I need to practise though,
  so I'll call this one a win.
&lt;/p&gt;

  Despite going to bed late, I still plan on getting up early tomorrow
  to try to smash through some more CS50. g0g0g0g0 me

  Today I enrolled in Harvard's CS50x, the online version of its Introduction
  to Computer Science module. From what I can tell, CS50 basically covers
  all the actual computer science necessary for being a software engineer,
  and as such it is well respected within the industry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I have heard the course is fairly hard, and knowing myself, I am
  somewhat worried that I will burn out, however I shelled out $90
  for a certificate at the end, so hopefully that will motivate me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I completed problem set 0 today, which involved making a programme in
  Scratch, coincidentally enough the same language we use to teach
  10 year olds at Code Club. It was pretty fun, and I made something
  with some basic logic in, but the amount of repeating myself I did
  was pretty gross - if anyone has any suggestions for refactoring,
  they'd be greatly appreciated! You can see the project
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/252383243/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Problem set 1 is based around C, somewhat at the other end of the
  spectrum to Scratch. Fortunately the basics at least vaguely resemble
  PHP, so I am not completely at sea (pun wholeheartedly intended), but
  I think it's going to ramp up pretty quickly. GL me.

  Today was another perfect example of why having an ego and being
  a programmer seem completely incompatible. This site is built
  only really using HTML and CSS - admittedly there is some templating
  and preprocessing done with Sass/Liquid etc - but it should still
  be easy enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I spent maybe two hours today staring at the mobile styling
  for this page. I had a regular desktop browser set to 375px
  wide, but everything was too small, and the DOM elements
  were telling me that there were bigger than they demonstrably were.
  &lt;code&gt;console.log(screen.width);&lt;/code&gt; returned 375px - what we'd
  expect. &lt;code&gt;console.log(document.querySelector('body').screenWidth);&lt;/code&gt;
  however, returned 980px, despite it clearly being visually
  less than the width of the device. I even hooked up an old
  android phone to my PC and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options&quot;&gt;
  installed developer options by tapping the build number 7 times.&lt;/a&gt; I had no joy whatsoever.
  What. The. Fuck.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Except not really what the fuck, because anyone who would so
  brazenly call themselves a web developer, as I have, would
  know that the first thing to check would be whether or not
  a meta value had been set for the viewport. I'm a clown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  At least I am a clown who learned something, and I suspect
  this is the last time I make this mistake again - at the very
  least I hope it is the last time I waste nearly 2 hours trying
  to correct it. The relief when I could finally get media queries
  working correctly was palpable.

  I have had a pretty ambivalent relationship with my phone for quite
  a while now. On one hand, all of us would struggle to forgo
  one altogether, given it is now a primary driver in almost all of
  our social and professional lives. Having the seemingly infinite
  wealth of human knowledge at my fingertips seems invaluable a lot of
  the time, especially when I'm trying to impress at dinner parties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  That was a joke. Obviously I don't get invited to parties, dinner
  or otherwise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The point remains though - it is not exactly a hot take to suggest
  we are &quot;enslaved&quot; to our phones, or some other suitably sensational
  choice of phrase. I spend a decent amount of time on my phone, and
  quite a lot of that time I suspect does not really benefit me, often
  making me experience things negatively, eg the increasing-less-mild sense
  of nihilism I have whenever I read the news. So overall is my phone
  +EV for me, I should I, ever the contrarian-wannabe-hipster-douchebag,
  stop using me phone (and then immediately proceed to brag about it to everyone
  who'll listen)?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  No. I am trying not to be &quot;that guy&quot;, and just admitting that I am
  millenial trash and that my iPhone dictates my life at this point.
  In the unending and naive quest to improve my life though, I discovered

  this&lt;/a&gt;, a simple post with a few relatively straightforward ideas to
  change one's iOS habits, with big promises about how it would impact
  my use of the device. I set everything up tonight and it was about as
  easy as advertised - only 15 minutes or so in total. So far I am
  enjoying the new layout a lot more than the old one, although of course
  it is early days yet. Unlocking my phone to see basically nothing is
  a pretty good reminder that I should probably just lock my phone
  again and get on with something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'll report back next weekend with how I feel after a week in this
  new bleak, minimalistic mobile landscape.

  I was inspired today by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-went-from-newbie-to-software-engineer-in-9-months-while-working-full-time-460bd8485847&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;
  this&lt;/a&gt; Medium article. I know inspiration will fade quickly, but
  I am hoping I can hold onto at least one thing from this article -
  it is never to late to start contributing to open source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One of the reasons I am a web developer is because I care a lot
  about the internet - I want it to be fast, accessible, to connect
  people and to improve our lives. Contributing to open source
  technology might seem sinful to some people, particularly in
  other professions. Giving up my time and expertise, for free?
  Volunteering, but not for those in need, for other developers?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Well, in my infinite ignorance, I think it's a noble cause. To have
  the opportunity to contribute to a large, growing, evolving codebase
  would feel amazing, and I am hoping I will have that opportunity soon.
  Imagine when I get my first patch in a big project... It's going to feel
  like a huge achievement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The article linked above says it's never to early to start contributing,
  and I suspect this is true, especially given I don't actually have to
  contribute code, nor do I have to contribute to a major library.
  There are some pretty massive projects out there with terrible documentation -
  Drupal, I am looking at you - so something like that seems like a natural
  place to start. Obviously I am not going to try to write documentation
  for Drupal though, because that would require understanding it, and honestly
  Drupal is nuts to me. My weekend homework (once this site is finished)
  is going to be researching the best way to start my open source journey -
  hopefully it is a long one.

My weekend homework (once this site is finished) is going to be researching the best way to start my open source journey - hopefully it is a long one.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">We are Live - ish</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2018/10/10/we-are-live-ish.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="We are Live - ish" /><published>2018-10-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-10-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2018/10/10/we-are-live-ish</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2018/10/10/we-are-live-ish.html">&lt;p&gt;
  This is the first daily post which is going to be uploaded to this new
  Jekyll site on the same day it was published! The URL is currently
  jonnyspicer.github.io but assuming I get everything finished by the
  end of the weekend, I'll swap the domain over to jonnyspicer.com -
  an exciting time. It has taken a long time for me to even start this project
  and in the end, it didn't even require that many hours, &amp;lt;20 so far,
  including having to learn Jekyll.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Overall I am pretty happy, I like the minimal look, Jekyll has not been
  painless but it hasn't been excruciating either. There is a bit more
  effort involed in actually generating a blog post then there would be
  with a CMS, as evidenced by the fact I am writing this in my text editor
  - there's no wysiwyg to catch any embarrassing spelling mistakes. I also
  have to manually generate the post file with a specific date/name convention
  but after the site is complete I'll write a script to do that for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Left to do as of 10th Oct 2018:
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Set up home page with excerpts of last post in each blog;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Change blog pages to just show last 5-10 posts for each blog,
      with dates;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Add full archive pages, grouped by date;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Review mobile/tablet styling (should just be changing font size...);
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Add CNAME file to repo;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Change DNS for jonnyspicer.com to point to this site.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
