  &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/08/success&quot;&gt;Success&lt;/a&gt; was pretty comfortably
  the most successful (pun wholeheartedly intended) post on my old
  Wordpress site, in terms of page views. It is also my favourite post
  there, and probably one of my favourite things I've ever written.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I published it a year today, so it seemed appropriate to reflect
  upon some of the things on the list, and maybe see if there is anything
  I can add to it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Firstly, there are quite a few about my sexual exploits. This year
  has... not been successful on that front. But there's always next
  year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There are some cool gaming ones - I would definitely add attending
  FACEIT Major London to the list, a LAN much bigger than Dreamhack
  London. Seeing 10000 nerds all packed into an arena cheering
  at some other nerds playing videogames on a stage really validated
  my lifelong commitment to nerdom. I made good on my promise to get
  a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.speedrun.com/Refunct/run/mekevn3m&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
  sub 3 minute Refunct run&lt;/a&gt; too!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The handful about poker and career were obviously written from a different
  place. I'm happy that I still view all those things as achievements,
  even if I didn't turn out to be the next cumicon. Would I add anything
  to the list on this topic? Perhaps, I think getting hired for a position
  I am aggressively underqualified for is something of an achievement. I built
  my first two commercial sites, and I actually think they are of a reasonable quality.
  I designed and built this site, although 'designed' is a bit of a stretch. Overall,
  Seem neat things, and some things I ought to recognise as successes - but
  I am more excited for potential greater career achievements in the next couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One of the list from list year really sticks out for me in the context of
  the last 365 days - #65 'kicked depression in the dick'. It turns out, that
  injuring something's genitals is actually only exceptionally rarely fatal.
  Considering depression well and truly beaten is one success that I am going
  to have to put on ice for the foreseeable future, although I think there
  are some successes this year that have come out of it - namely, surviving
  and even being a relatively functional member of society. I got and maintaiend
  a new job, still maintain a good group of friends, and just signed the
  lease for a new flat, despite having really struggled with my mental health
  in the last 12 months. Good job, me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I touched on it in my post yesterday, but one of the biggest changes (and,
  I think, successes) that I see in myself in the last year is that I care about
  stuff a lot more. I have become more socially conscious, I no longer actively
  avoid learning about politics, I closely follow tech news, I want to change my own lifestyle to combat
  climate change, I want to contribute to effective altruism. This time last year,
  I was very much more focused on myself, and my own success, viewing those other
  things as distractions that would cause me stress and sadness. Now, I think
  these things can help me feel like part of something bigger, which I am led
  to believe could make me happier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's been a difficult year, and in some ways there aren't many new successes
  of the ilk that I wrote about last year. But I think there are plenty of more
  subtle, nuanced ones, that make me excited about the next year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And, it is my birthday, which means I am listening to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTFAXK-f4N4&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;
  this song&lt;/a&gt; all day.

  It is pretty bizarre to me how big a part of news media aimed at me consists
  of US politics. Even UK politics ought not to effect me that much, given
  that Guernsey is self-governing, but I can forgive people here an interest
  in our mainland counterparts. American politics on the other hand... is
  thousands of miles away. I hope it will never really effect me, and I suspect
  it will certainly never meaningful change my existence unless we enter some
  kind of mutually-assured-destruction scenario.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  With that being said, I have in general pretty liberal views, and more and
  more governments across the world seem to be shifting to the right. I think
  this is, uh, bad. Because it's incongruent with my views, and I'm a bit
  worried about what's going to become of humanity as a species if our
  societies shift that way. I don't really know anything about anything
  though, so I probably don't really get to have an opinion on the subject
  of politics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  With all that being said, I read a little about the results of the US
  mid terms today, and in general it seemed positive for us liberal snowflakes.
  So, good job everybody.

  Following on from my &lt;a href=&quot;/mendokusai/2018/10/26/lifestyle-changes.html&quot;&gt;
  post on Oct 26th,&lt;/a&gt; I am planning on going a step further than cutting
  out red meat, and am going to at least try a fully plant-based, vegan
  diet. I signed the lease on a new flat yesterday with a friend, and move in
  on January 29th, so I have nearly two full months of research and planning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I have made these kinds of statements, especially about diet, many times before,
  and I have failed to follow through on them pretty much without exception.
  What will be different this time? I am hoping a change in living situation,
  combined with a roommate who has a generally pretty healthy lifestyle,
  will be a good start towards possible change. Perhaps the socially
  conscious nature of the change will help too, and maybe if I obnoxiously
  blog about it all the time, that will keep me accountable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Or maybe I'll just book a massive freeroll.

  I caught up with a poker friend that I had not spoken to in a very
  long time over the weekend. He had just got back into playing full time
  after having taken a year away from the game to complete his studies,
  and his reflections on his return to the game were insightful and
  hilarious in equal measure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Paraphrased:
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Poker is so frustrating. In almost everything else in life, you
      get instant feedback... like in cooking. If you burn your food, you
      know you fucked up. In poker, you can play perfectly and still burn
      your food over and over again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hearing him say that sentence made me unbelievably glad I no longer
  have to deal with the stress of playing poker full time.

  Last night, Joona &quot;Serral&quot; Sotala made esports history. He was the first non-Korean
  player to reach the world championship final in the 20 years the game has had one -
  but not only that, the Finnish Zerg won, becoming the first world champion
  not to carry the Korean flag.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For some context - in Starcraft, Koreans are so dominant that any player who
  is not Korean is simply referred to as a &quot;foreigner&quot;. It's been a running joke
  in the Starcraft community for years, that even mediocre Koreans will always
  outshine foreign players. When any passionate fans are debating the greatest
  foreigners of all time, it will always come down to the very small handful
  who have been able to compete with Koreans and come out roughly equal. But none of them
  have achieved what Serral has achieved - on top of winning the world championship,
  he won all four major non-Korean tournaments this year, and GSL vs the World,
  the clash of the two regions (GSL is the top Korean league). He was also the first
  foreigner to take the crown in that tournament, and is one of a select few foreigners
  to have won a major tournament on Korean soil.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Before the world championships, there were whispers that the gap was closing.
  Reddit was unusually optimistic. The Korean players, usually dismissive of
  foreigners in interviews, didn't want to get drawn against Serral. They were scared -
  they didn't want to be the ones to lose to a foreigner. But they all did:
  Serral defeated an all-star lineup of the best players Seoul has to offer,
  having faced a Korean player in every single match he played in the tournament.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The first time I watched Serral play Starcraft, it was at Dreamhack Valencia 2013,
  when he was 14. He took a game off Life, who would go on to be the world champion
  next year, and is considered one of the best players of the modern era.
  I remember thinking Serral was promising for his age, but I never
  imagined he would achieve what he has this year. Before, fans would talk about
  which player would be the &quot;foreign hope&quot;. Serral has made our hope a reality,
  in one of the most inspiring and emotional displays of skill I've ever seen on an esports
  stage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Thank you Serral, for making me proud to be a fan of Starcraft, esports and gaming.
&lt;/p&gt;

  For a few years now, I have been a fan of the idea that your happiness is
  your reality minus your expectations. It seems to make a lot of sense to me,
  but I have never been very happy, despite having what I thought were low
  expectations. Having thought about it a little more recently, with some help
  from my therapist... I actually have insane, wholly unrealistic expectations.
  Here are some of them:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to improve my front end web dev skills very rapidly, across multiple
    languages and frameworks;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to improve my back end web dev skills very rapidly, across multiple
    languages and frameworks;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to pick up other software development skills and programming languages,
    including machine learning in python, native app development, c++ development,
    unit testing, scalable database management...;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to improve my computer science knowledge, and pass CS50 as quickly
    as possible;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to improve at basic maths, including linear algebra and algorithms;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to learn about the world, and keep up to date with the latest news
    in technology and science;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to learn about penetration, be able to secure bug bounties, and
    keep up with CVEs for all major platforms and devices;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to be working on multiple coding side-projects, be building useful
    applications and growing my portfolio;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to be completely comfortable using the Linux command line to do anything,
    as well as having an excellent knowledge of Windows and MacOS;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to be able to understand every stage of deployment and scaling for an
    app on an Apache server, and have a thorough understanding of Apache in general;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to go to the gym 5-6 times a week, and see an improvement in my
    cardiovascular fitness and all three main lifts;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to eat less and lose weight;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to get better at chess;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to maintain a group of friends, spend time with them,
    and get closer to some of them;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to be likeable, unawkward, and easily form a rapport with new people
    I meet;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to spend more time with my brother, give him good advice and help him
    be happier and maximise his life experience;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect not to upset, anger or disappoint my friends, family or coworkers;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect myself to have other hobbies and interests outside of tech, chess
    and the gym, and I expect myself to try and be open to trying new things;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to get 8+ hours of sleep every night;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect my career to progress rapidly;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect myself to overcome my anxiety and depression;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    I expect to be able to do this, with only 24 hours in a day, without succumbing
    to stress, while being able to balance relaxation that doesn't contribute to
    my personal growth, eg following esports.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Why I expect all this is a story for another day. But, I think I figured out
  why I'm sad all the time.

Here are some of them: I expect to improve my front end web dev skills very rapidly, across multiple languages and frameworks; I expect to improve my back end web dev skills very rapidly, across multiple languages and frameworks; I expect to pick up other software development skills and programming languages, including machine learning in python, native app development, c++ development, unit testing, scalable database management...; I expect to improve my computer science knowledge, and pass CS50 as quickly as possible; I expect to improve at basic maths, including linear algebra and algorithms; I expect to learn about the world, and keep up to date with the latest news in technology and science; I expect to learn about penetration, be able to secure bug bounties, and keep up with CVEs for all major platforms and devices; I expect to be working on multiple coding side-projects, be building useful applications and growing my portfolio; I expect to be completely comfortable using the Linux command line to do anything, as well as having an excellent knowledge of Windows and MacOS; I expect to be able to understand every stage of deployment and scaling for an app on an Apache server, and have a thorough understanding of Apache in general; I expect to go to the gym 5-6 times a week, and see an improvement in my cardiovascular fitness and all three main lifts; I expect to eat less and lose weight; I expect to get better at chess; I expect to maintain a group of friends, spend time with them, and get closer to some of them; I expect to be likeable, unawkward, and easily form a rapport with new people I meet; I expect to spend more time with my brother, give him good advice and help him be happier and maximise his life experience; I expect not to upset, anger or disappoint my friends, family or coworkers; I expect myself to have other hobbies and interests outside of tech, chess and the gym, and I expect myself to try and be open to trying new things; I expect to get 8+ hours of sleep every night; I expect my career to progress rapidly; I expect myself to overcome my anxiety and depression; I expect to be able to do this, with only 24 hours in a day, without succumbing to stress, while being able to balance relaxation that doesn't contribute to my personal growth, eg following esports. Why I expect all this is a story for another day. But, I think I figured out why I'm sad all the time.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Money Makes Me Sad</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2018/11/02/money-makes-me-sad.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Money Makes Me Sad" /><published>2018-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2018/11/02/money-makes-me-sad</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mendokusai/2018/11/02/money-makes-me-sad.html">&lt;p&gt;
  In another post I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;
  80000 hours,&lt;/a&gt; and today I read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/career-guide/anyone-make-a-difference/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;
  third chapter&lt;/a&gt; in their career guide,
  &quot;No matter your job, here's 3 evidence-based ways anyone can have a real impact&quot;.
  The number one way involves effective altruism, ie donating to charities that
  have been shown to have the biggest impact on human life per dollar donated, or
  bang for your buck if you will.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The reasoning employed is approximately as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Past a certain income threshold, any additional income provides you with
    proportionally less additional happiness and life satisfaction;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    By participating in effective altruism and donating to high-impact charities,
    you can make a substantial, tangible difference to the lives of a meaningful
    number of people by donating, for example, 10% of you income;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The happiness and satisfaction you will get from making these donations will
    significantly outweigh the happiness you would get from keeping this money,
    and this has been quantifiably proven in studies.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I think intuitively this makes a lot of sense and is very likely to be true, without delving
  too much into the studies that are referenced. Before I continue, I am admittedly
  below the income/happiness threshold, but it is not inconceivable that I reach it
  in the next few years - I think I am likely to do so by the time I am 30. I also
  don't think it's inconceivable that I would be happier donating 10% of my salary now
  than not doing so. &lt;i&gt;But...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When I think about making a commitment to donating a significant portion of my salary,
  I think about the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What if I need to support my parents financially in the future?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What if I need to support my brother financially in the future?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What if I get made redundant and am unable to find work in the future?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What if I want to have kids in the future?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What if I want to own my own property in the future?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What if I get seriously ill in the future?
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And on a perhaps less critical but still arguably equally valid note:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What if I want to go travelling in the future?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What if I want to buy x, y or z nice thing in the future?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Can I use the entirety of my income to maximise my own human experience in my lifetime?&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And that... made me kinda sad. I would imagine my mindset if very similar to
  a lot of people in Western society - we have a lot of different pressures driving
  us to try to generate as much wealth as possible. It contributes a lot to my anxiety,
  a vague sense of fear of not having accrued enough capital at some arbitrary point
  in the future. I don't think I spend recklessly, but I could definitely be more
  frugal or save more aggressively, and sometimes that leads me to feel guilty
  about a bunch of really small things that I don't need to be feeling guilty
  about at this point in my life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As always, I don't know what the answer is. Perhaps I'll start small. I'm considering
  giving up alcohol - if I do, maybe I'll donate the money I would've spent on beer
  to an effective cause every month. And then I'll blog about it and tell everyone
  about it all the time, and be a real self-righteous prick about the whole thing,
  and if being that prick feels as good as I suspect it might, then I'll donate
  more and be an even greater prick about it.

  When I first started this blog, it was solely to win a bet. The idea
  behind our blog-a-day last longer was in part that we could go back
  and read our old blogs, and see how our ideas had changed and how
  we'd grown as people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I totally won the bet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  But recently, I have come to see the value in reflecting on some of
  my old posts, which was the motivation for the bet itself. So I wanted
  to write some posts where I revisit old writing, ideas, outlooks on life.
  These are obviously all relatively recent (unless I can dig out some old
  bits and pieces off since-deleted social media or similar), but I am surprised
  at some of the things I wrote mere months ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Where better to start then with the first post on this blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonnyspicer.com/mendokusai/2017/10/16/gambling-and-catharsis.html&quot;&gt;
  Gambling and Catharsis,&lt;/a&gt; posted on 16th October 2017, a little over
  a year ago now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There isn't much that I say in that post that I haven't already said
  in this one, but the one thing that stands out to me is that I still
  obviously consider myself a poker player/gambler at the time. There is
  still hope there that I will make it work and be successful in that arena,
  which I have since abandoned. I'm not sure if it was naïveté, if I was
  putting on a front, if I knew I was doomed already or what. It's tough to
  say whether or not I miss that feeling, or want it back, or wish I was still
  playing poker, if I could swap my current &quot;career&quot; for another shot at it,
  if I wish I had had more success with the game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Either way - I learned a lot, about myself, about the world, and about life.

  I often worry I am too open on this blog. This post, doubly so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I've been having a rough time lately, but one of the things that has been
  cheering me up lately is... &lt;a href=&quot;https://oglaf.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;OGLAF.&lt;/a&gt;
  Is it a webcomic? Kinda. Is it porn? Well, it is certainly &lt;i&gt;pornographic&lt;/i&gt; in
  parts at least, so I guess... maybe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Am I recommending you porn? I hope not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's funny, in a slightly outrageous way. It just also happens to have a lot of
  genitals in it too. If you can suspend judgment and read it with an open mind...
  I think it is pretty good.

  In my recent quest for sad songs, I have rediscovered Julien Baker, affectionately
  known to her fans as the Sad Queen. She is definitely worth of that moniker,
  her music is haunting and sombre, but with a purity and beauty that make it
  more than worth listening to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  She has a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/GiNPcLwSeME&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;set on KEXP,&lt;/a&gt; 10/10 heartily recommending.
