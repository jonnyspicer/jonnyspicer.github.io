  <h1>The Depths of the Blog</h1>

  <p>
    20 Feb 2017
    
    
  </p>

  <p>I am one of the most introverted people I know, which to me is quite remarkably, given a lot of people I know have been met either through online gaming or online poker, two decidedly antisocial activities. But as such, I struggle to hold a conversation with someone, find it exhausting, and often have a lot on my chest I want to talk about with <em>someone</em> but don&#8217;t feel able to, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this blog is going to be to talk about whatever those things may be with <em>you,</em> dear reader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to reciprocate with your thoughts. Writing openly and honestly, and then punting that writing as far into the nothingness of the internet as possible, is cathartic for me, and I treat it like therapy. I hope that you will enjoy being a fly on the wall in my conversations with myself, where I try to talk out whatever it is that has been bothering me, and ultimately find peace and closure at the end of each post.</p>
