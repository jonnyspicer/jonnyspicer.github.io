  <h1>What if I had epilepsy?</h1>

  <p><span style="font-weight:400;">What if I had epilepsy?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If I had a family history of epilepsy, perhaps my parents would’ve told me about it when I was younger, so I could be prepared if it I had a seizure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If I had a seizure when I was a child, maybe I would have told someone. I might have looked at the other children, realised that they were not having seizures, and understood that there was something wrong, and I should speak to my teacher or my parents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If I had epilepsy, perhaps it wouldn’t have taken me five years to realise that’s what the problem was. Perhaps I wouldn’t be scared to tell anyone about my seizures, but perhaps I would.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Maybe I wouldn’t be scared of being judged for having epilepsy. Maybe I’d wear a wristband so other people could see, and understand what was going on. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If my friends asked me “how are you today?” and I’d had a bad seizure, maybe I’d say “not so good, my body hurts.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If I felt like I was going to have a seizure, maybe I would say “Mum, Dad, please help me. I think I’m going to have a seizure.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Maybe I would tell them that I’m scared for the future, because of my epilepsy, I’m scared that it’ll never get better. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Maybe I wouldn’t feel ashamed to talk about my epilespsy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I don’t have epilepsy. I do have borderline personality disorder. What’s the difference?</span></p>
