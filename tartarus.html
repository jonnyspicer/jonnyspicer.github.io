<h1>Thoughts from Tartarus</h1>
<p>
  This is my older, long-form blog
  where I infrequently make essay-style posts. The name is a lame
  twofold joke I have with myself - my poker screenname is "persephoney"
  and the posts here are usually self-absorbed complaints, as if I
  feel like I am in a hell of mythological proportion. I promise
  it's not all whiny though.
</p>
<ul class="recent-posts">
  {% for post in site.categories.tartarus offset: 0 limit: 5 %}
    <li>
      <h4><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h4>
      <span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }} | {{ post.tags | sort | join: ", " }}</span>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
