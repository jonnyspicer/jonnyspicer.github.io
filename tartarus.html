  <h1>Thoughts from Tartarus</h1>
  <p>
    Tartarus is the Ancient Greek name for the deepest part of the underworld, the prison which held the Titans, as well as providing some run-of-the-mill torment and suffering
    to mere mortals who's hourglass had run out. The name is a lame twofold joke I have with myself - my poker screenname is "persephoney", as in the queen of the underworld,
    and the posts here are usually self-absorbed complaints, as if I feel like I am in a hell of mythological proportion. I promise it's not all whiny though.
