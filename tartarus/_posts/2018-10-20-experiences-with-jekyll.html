  Having (finally) got round to rebuilding this site, I thought it would
  be nice to talk a little bit about the process of doing so, from learning
  Jekyll, to design, to development and deployment. All of them are,
  in the case of this site, pretty basic, given the basic nature of the
  site, but hey, I'm still fairly new at this.
</p>
<p>
  My old site was Wordpress-hosted, which was frankly embarrassing. Aside
  from the limitations of this, not knowing that I'd written all of the
  code (in fact, having written none of the code whatsoever), didn't
  really make me feel like it was <strong>my</strong> website. Sure,
  I could self-host Wordpress or some other PHP-based CMS and get my hands
  dirty in the source code if I wanted to, but a CMS would be overkill
  for this kind of site, and besides, I'm supposedly a developer, I ought
  not to need some shiny UI to manage my content.
</p>
<p>
  Jekyll seemed like the obvious choice, mostly because of free hosting
  on Github Pages. I'm 90% sure I could host this site for free on AWS,
  but I haven't bothered to actually figure it out yet, so Pages is
  our home now, and Pages pushes Jekyll. I'd never used any SSG before,
  and seeing as Jekyll is #1 on <a href="https://staticgen.com">
  Staticgen,</a> it seemed like a relatively easy choice. In retrospect,
  maybe I should've used a Javascript-based SSG rather than one which
  uses Ruby, which I know nothing about and in fact had to install
  on my home machine at the start of the project, but I don't have too
  much bad to say about Jekyll.
</p>
<p>
  There were a few hiccoughs - I was pretty skeptical when installing the
  aforementioned Ruby for the first time, as I am growing increasingly wary of package
  managers exacerbating the problems they are supposedly meant to solve.
  The documentation for Jekyll isn't tooooo bad (nb, being a Drupal developer
  has forever changed the way I think about documentation. In my view,
  any documentation is good documentation...), and there is a decent
  enough SE community too. The two issues I ran into were kinda funny
  in the end - firstly I broke the automatic rerender on the local
  environment, and I still don't know how. For some reason, running
  <code>bundle update</code> fixed it, but I am fairly sure I hadn't
  pulled or made any changes from the network at all between it working
  and it breaking... maybe I am just dumb. I also kept getting build
  errors when I deployed to Pages, despite my build working just fine
  locally. I know Pages builds in super-strict mode or whatever, but
  I had the <code>github-pages</code> gem which is supposed to keep
  all your packages in-line with the ones on Pages. Turns out, having
  everything in a single directory underneath the repo root was breaking
  everything - lol.
</p>
<p>
  Templating is obviously pretty natural for anyone who has ever done
  anything with a CMS before, so that bit was quite easy, and the syntax
  wasn't too hard. Liquid mostly makes sense too, it isn't immediately
  obvious that it's actually quite useful, but with some well placed
  search queries, you can dig up some nice how-tos for things like
  better excerpts (the default is a bit shit) and proper navigation.
  I am still curious as to why they call it "front matter", but regardless
  of its name, fortunately I found it relatively intuitive also.
</p>
<p>
  With regards to design, I am obviously no designer. In fact, not only
  am I "no designer", I have no knowledge, no training, no experience -
  no nothing - of design. All I really have is reference points, and the ability
  as a user to say "that's cool" or "that's kinda ugly". I wanted to focus
  on readability and good typesetting, inspired a little by iOS Safari's
  reader view, and the Kindle app. The content is meant to be the focus,
  and the rest of the page should not be distracting - take your time,
  read what is in front of you. I also wanted to fit in with what seems
  to be the trend in personal tech blogs - they have a minimalist feel,
  often with few or no images, default fonts, and generally they look
  like late 90s sites, even if the author clearly has the ability to
  bring them in line with 21st century trends. <a href="http://paulgraham.com/lisp.html" rel="noreferrer">
  Paul Graham's site</a> is a great example of this, and I love visiting it.
</p>
<p>
  Part of the reason this site is monochrome is because I like it,
  but a much large part of the reason is that I was too scared to add
  colours. If I was going to have a primary colour for this site,
  it would have to represent my personality... which colour represents
  my personality (I'm a Scorpio if it helps)?
</p>
<p>
  Trick question, the answer is black, the colour on the site.
</p>
<p>
  There aren't any images (yet) either, despite the old site having
  a featured image on every post, and quite a few on the other pages.
  Part of this was due to the horrible way whichever Wordpress theme
  I was using would style images - it would left-align and then crop
  so they were less than the width-wrapper, I mean what the fuck - and
  a more important part is that now I see how much the quality of imagery
  has an effect on the quality of the site itself. So, no more shitty
  iPhone pictures. There will maybe be images at some point, if I can
  get some nice ones off <a href="https://unsplash.com" rel="noreferrer">
  Unsplash</a> or something.
</p>
<p>
  The final piece of the puzzle that was deciding how to build this site
  was the one I actually think is coolest. You see... this site has no Javascript.
  Animated link underline? CSS. Accordions? CSS. Hamburger menu on mobile? CSS. Trackers?
  Don't have any. (If you want me to know you've read my post, you can find
  my email on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.html %}">
  about page.</a>) Admittedly, these are somewhat hack-y, Javascript
  could definitely do them better, and they are terrible for accessibility,
  but the tradeoff is better performance and a fully functioning website even
  with scripts disabled. I think a lot of developers ignore accessibility
  and that is a big problem, however I think a lot of developers also
  put far too much JS on all their pages and <strong>that's killing the internet.</strong>
  So, in the end, I think it is a trade worth making - perhaps in the future
  I could look at alternative ways of navigating the site, that would be
  more accessible.
</p>
<p>
  It was fun to pick up a new technology, and I think the biggest takeaway
  I have from this site is that learning something new <i>should</i> be fun,
  and in the process, expect to do badly, to write horrible code, to throw
  code away and start again. The SASS for this site is a fucking <strong>
  mess</strong>, because I started writing it not even knowing what the
  file structure was going to look like, as I was learning on the fly. Sure,
  in a sense, that's bad, but spending 2 hours trying to map out my site
  without really even understanding the templating or page generation
  of sites, would've been worse. I definitely get struck by overplanning-paralysis
  as much as the next guy, but I am glad I didn't get too emotionally attached
  to anything I wrote at the beginning of this project (it's only SASS after all),
  so I had no problem ripping it out and starting again. To be honest it still
  needs ripping out and starting again, so I am going to put my refactoring
  hat on at some point this week.
</p>
<p>
  I would say Jekyll is pretty neat overall. Of course it has some drawbacks,
  it cannot do some things you would expect or want it to do, for example
  there isn't an especially easy way to group or show posts by date, and
  the only way I have found of filtering by tag is to manually create a page
  for every tag and then link to it - I may have not been trying hard
  enough to find the solution though. If you're a developer, it's a pretty nice
  way to write a blog, it is relatively pain free and the flexibility is nice -
  just don't expect to expand too much or add any extra features.
</p>
<p>
  In the future, I am hoping I can be constantly improving the site, be it
  the design, the performance or the content. I have a tonne of things left
  on my to do list for the site, such as adding blockquote element styling,
  better code element styling, and configuring the SEO tag module properly.
  I am hoping to write more entries for Thoughts from Tartarus, and I know I
  say that every time, but I have found writing daily especially cathartic
  recently, and I think I am slowly "finding my voice" again, so perhaps
  I will make good on my promise of more posts this time.

  Who am I kidding. If you don't read Mendokusai, see you next year!
