<span >I had my first meeting with a new therapist today. My homework for the week is to think about how I relate to people, what I do well or not so well etc. I think the answer is likely to be that I don't do a great job, but I'm trying to be objective about it all. I'm sure I'll write some of my thoughts about it all later in the week.</span>
