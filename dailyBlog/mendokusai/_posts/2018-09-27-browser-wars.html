<span >Brave browser... I really want to use you... but why do so many DOM elements not work properly in you... why don't your own extensions work properly, given there are only 10 available... Are Basic Attention Tokens even a good idea... So many questions that I'm not sure you have answers too. I at least like the concept of you more than Firefox though, so it looks like you're still on trial.</span>
