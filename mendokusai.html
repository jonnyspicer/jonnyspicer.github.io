    Mendokusai is a Japanese word which roughly translates to "troublesome", in the sense that it's frequently troublesome to write a blog every day just to win a meagre amount of your
    friend's cryptocurrency. Sometimes the posts are just a couple of lines long, and sometimes while writing I black out and wake up to find I've written an essay of respectable length.
    They are also often unplanned, unstructured and unedited; read at your peril.
