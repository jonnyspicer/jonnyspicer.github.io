Twenty five is a pretty cosy number for all us base 10 users. It only has prime factors. It can be part of a Pythagorean triplet.
It's a multiple of 5, second only to multiples of 10 in terms of comfort of use. As a number, I think everyone would agree that it
is a good one.

However, as an age, I am struggling to say I find it quite so enjoyable. At least, so far - it's only been a day. Perhaps it'll grow
on me. My housemate turned 25 in September, and I think he summed it up best when I asked him how it felt:

> When you're younger, you look forward to your birthday. And then when you get a bit older, you're not really excited about it anymore; it's just like "oh, I'm getting old". But this year it was like, "oh... fucking hell".

Still, my 25th birthday seems like as good an arbitrary point as any to bury a time capsule of my thoughts on the internet, and
so despite my recent absence from writing, I didn't want to let this opportunity pass me by. Seeing as I haven't written anything
for a while, there has naturally been plenty on my mind and plenty of things I could write about, but it's all a bit jumbled, so
here are some rather disordered thoughts and faux-reflections on life, for the benefit and likely amusement of my future self.
