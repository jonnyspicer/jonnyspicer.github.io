This evening I had planned to write a part II to an old post, so was leafing through them to find an appropriate starting point. I was 
enjoying the process a lot, smiling as I reconnected with my past self, until I got to [this post](https://jonnyspicer.com/mendokusai/2018/03/30/failure)
which I'm sure I thought was harmless at the time, but in retrospect I am not proud of myself for having written. As a result, it seems an important 
post to write a sequel to, and hopefully it will be a good opportunity to see what has changed in the past year.

Most of my problem is with the title of the post, because I know that is was certainly not tongue-in-cheek, and was meant wholly sincerely. My 
self-pitying tone also isn't great, but if I'm going to start calling out my previous self for doing that then we'd be here all night, so I'll 
let that slide. I think entitling the original 'failure' is both a disservice to myself and to anyone who I may have 'failed' to have intimate 
relations with the night prior. The narrative that people of any gender are some kind of challenge where one may succeed or fall short is 
damaging to everyone involved. I was clearly feeling lonely at the time and I was in a bad place regardless, but it makes me cringe to 
remember how I felt writing that - there was undoubtedly some amount of entitlement and expectation, and now I won't accept that attitude from 
myself.
