  A couple of years ago, Johannes Haushofer published his <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf"
  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CV of Failures</a>, and Twitter loved it. I
  also loved it when I recently came across it, and while pontificating to myself
  that my failures are actually my greatest successes, I thought it would be a
  good idea to write my own.

    Failed Further Mathematics AS Level with U grade, subsequently dropped the
