  Drinking is a high variance situation. Some of my favourite memories are from
  times when I was plastered, and alcohol is clearly a wonderful social lubricant
  for an anxious little boy like me. But, obviously it can have some pretty negative
  consequences, something I felt strongly about when I woke up at midday today, with
  my head pounding and the taste of cheap rum and questionable decisions in my mouth.

  Calculating EV in these high variance, low sample size situations is tough, but  
  I think this is a great opportunity to apply Bayes' Law.
