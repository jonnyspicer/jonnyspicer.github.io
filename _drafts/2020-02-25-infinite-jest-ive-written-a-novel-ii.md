Not only have I written over 150,000 words on this blog, I have apparently used 20,161 unique ones -
a mere 423 behind the 20,584 used by DFW in Infinite Jest. Intuitively that seems incorrect 
however, and I think there are a number of possible reasons for my lexicon being inflated such 
that it nears DFW's;

- I write about a broader range of subjects, and therefor use more jargon and technical words;
- The unique word count, unlike the raw word count, will be artificially increased by hyphenated
words, for example if I have erred in consistency and sometimes used "co-operate" and sometimes 
"cooperate", the script will count that as two words when it really ought to be one;
- I am missing something big and obvious in the preprocessing of the words in the script, at the
moment the only action I am taking is to cast everything to lowercase;
- There is an incredibly slim possibility that I am in fact a literary genius.

Regardless, it's done wonders for my ego. It's also a good excuse to learn pandas and try to look
at the distribution of words used, to try and figure out what it is that I am clearly missing here.
