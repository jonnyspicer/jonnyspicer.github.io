  For over a year I've had a Trello list of blog ideas. Most of them are
  ones I want to write about at length, as they are complex topics with a
  lot of meaning to me, and because of that I rarely find the time or the
  motivation to write about them. One of the ideas that has sat on the list
  since the beginning, is a series of posts about some of the people who have
  changed my life. There's a handful of people out there who made a massive
  impact on the person I am today, and I am happier and more confident because
  of them. Two of the people in my mental list don't even know this, as
  we are not really close, or even really friends. Our interactions were years
  ago, but they taught me something valuable.

  This is about one of those people,
